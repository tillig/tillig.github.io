**My name is Travis Illig.** I'm an Enterprise Architect for [Fiserv Corporation](http://www.fiserv.com) working on next-generation online banking microservices and web applications.

I believe there is a certain art in solving problems in the computer science world and I enjoy practicing that art. Note that while all aspects of that art are interesting to me, my passion lies in technical leadership and architecture. In animation terms, I prefer to be [a keyframer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame).

When I am not programming for work, I sometimes code for fun. I'm a co-owner of [Autofac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac), a popular .NET inversion-of-control container. I have some [little web apps of my own](https://app.paraesthesia.com) including a ["Command Prompt Here" Generator](https://app.paraesthesia.com/CommandPromptHere/). Most everything [is on GitHub](https://github.com/tillig) nowadays, so head over there for more.

I also like playing games, working on [my media
center](https://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and collecting [movies](http://www.invelos.com/dvdcollection.aspx/tillig) and [music](https://connect.collectorz.com/users/tillig/music/view).

I am open to hearing about new opportunities, but only:

- Permanent, full-time positions.
- No relocation. (I'm in the Portland, OR metro area.)
- Something *very, very compelling*. I'm happy in my present position and changing jobs is not something I do lightly.

And, [please, **don't call me** - send email instead](/archive/2006/11/02/recruiter-pet-peeves.aspx). I cannot take your calls during the work day.

You can get [my resume in PDF format here](resume.pdf).
