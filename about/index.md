**My name is
Travis Illig.** I'm a .NET developer lead for [Fiserv
Corporation](http://www.fiserv.com) working on next-generation online
banking web applications.

I believe there is a certain art in solving problems in the computer
science world and I enjoy practicing that art. Note that while all
aspects of that art are interesting to me, my passion lies in technical
leadership and architecture. In animation terms, I prefer to be [a
keyframer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame).

When I am not programming for work, I contribute to some open source
projects. Some of the more popular ones include...

- **[Autofac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac)**, a popular .NET inversion-of-control container.
- **[CR\_Documentor](https://github.com/tillig/CR_Documentor)**, a plugin for Visual Studio that allows you to preview your XML API docs.
- **[SublimeMSBuild](https://github.com/tillig/SublimeMSBuild)**, a package for Sublime Text that enables statement completion and build using MSBuild.
- **[app.paraesthesia.com](http://app.paraesthesia.com)** hosts a few little web apps I've put up, like the [Command Prompt Here Generator](http://app.paraesthesia.com/CommandPromptHere/) and [LoyaltyCard](http://app.paraesthesia.com/LoyaltyCard/).

Most everything [is on GitHub](https://github.com/tillig) nowadays, so head over there for more.

I also like [playing games](http://live.xbox.com/member/Paraesthesia), working on [my media
center](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html), and collecting [movies](http://www.invelos.com/dvdcollection.aspx/tillig) and [music](http://connect.collectorz.com/users/tillig/music/view).

I am open to hearing about new opportunities, but only:

-   Permanent, full-time positions.
-   No relocation. (I'm in the Portland, OR metro area.)
-   Something *very, very compelling*. I'm happy in my present position
    and changing jobs is not something I do lightly.

And, [please, *don't call me* - send email
instead](/archive/2006/11/02/recruiter-pet-peeves.aspx).
I cannot take your calls during the work day.

**Certifications/Affiliations:**

-   Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD) in .NET
-   Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA) in SQL Server 2000
-   Typemock MVP
