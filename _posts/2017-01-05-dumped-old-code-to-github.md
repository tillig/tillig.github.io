Over the years I've pushed out a lot of little downloads, source, and code snippets on my blog. Yesterday I finally got all of that moved out of the various little dump sites on disks and in private repos and into GitHub.

I'll continue updating links and adding things when I find them, but you should be able to see most everything there:

- [Repositories](https://github.com/tillig) (contain more fully-fledged projects and things that can be built)
- [Gists](https://gist.github.com/tillig) (contain one-off files and snippets)

It was kind of a blast from the past looking at some of that stuff. I can see how I've changed styles and improved. Who _doesn't_ look at stuff they wrote 10 years ago and shake their head?

I could also see where I used certain tools or tech back then and don't anymore. Like... remember when [T4](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx) didn't exist and [CodeSmith](http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator) was the way to generate things? Anyone remember the [Prototype JS](http://prototypejs.org/) library? Building with [NAnt](http://nant.sourceforge.net/)?

I can't promise all of it will compile as-is. For example, I see a lot of VS 2003 and VS 2005 solutions in there. Will that straight-up convert to VS 2015+? Your guess is as good as mine.

Anyway, it felt good to get things centralized, even if it's not all stellar code.
