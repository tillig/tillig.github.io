If you're a user of those right-click "Command Prompt Here" context menu utilities... **[I just updated my Command Prompt Here Generator with a developer prompt for Visual Studio 2015.](http://app.paraesthesia.com/CommandPromptHere/)** Head over there to get an installer for "VS2015 Prompt Here" (or any other prompts you might be interested in).
