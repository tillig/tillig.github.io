I installed Visual Studio 2015 today. I had the RC installed and updated to the the RTM.

One of the minor-yet-annoying things I found about the RTM version showed up when I pinned it to my taskbar next to VS2013:

Sigh.

Luckily it's an easy fix.

## Windows 7 / Server 2008

First, unpin VS2015 from your taskbar. You'll put it back after you've fixed the icon.

Open up your Start menu and right-click on the "Visual Studio 2015" shortcut in there. On the context menu, choose "Properties." Click the "Change Icon" button.

VS2015 actually comes with a few icons. They're not all awesome, but they're at least different than the VS2013 icon. I chose the one with the little arrow because it's, you know, *upgraded from VS2013*.

Click OK enough times to close all the property dialogs. You'll see the icon in the Start menu has changed. Now right-click that and pin it to the taskbar. Problem solved.

## Windows 8 / Server 2012

If you haven't pinned VS2015 to your taskbar yet, do that now so you can get a shortcut.

Open up the taskbar icons folder. This is at `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar`.

*Copy* the "Visual Studio 2015" shortcut out of that folder and onto your desktop.

Unpin VS2015 from your taskbar. The shortcut in that `TaskBar` folder will disappear.

Right-click on the "Visual Studio 2015" shortcut you copied to your desktop. On the context menu, choose "Properties." Click the "Change Icon" button.

Right-click on the icon on your desktop and *pin that one* to your taskbar. A new shortcut with the correct icon will be added to that `TaskBar` folder and will appear on the taskbar. You can now delete the one from your desktop.
