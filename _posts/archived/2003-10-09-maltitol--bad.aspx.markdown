I figured out what was giving me the shits so bad earlier this week.
Maltitol.
 
 See, when the candy company makes sugar-free candy, they have to put
something in instead, right? Sometimes it's aspartame, sometimes it's
Splenda, sometimes it's sugar alcohol, and sometimes it's maltitol.
 
 Turns out, maltitol has a laxative effect. Which is putting it mildly
since, for me, it has more of a Montezuma's Revenge bent. I ate a candy
bar with maltitol in it at the hockey game last night (which was
AWESOME, by the way) and about 20 minutes later I was making a break for
the bathroom. I almost didn't make it home in the car, either. Terrible,
terrible, terrible.
 
 So now I have to figure out what kinds of sugar-free treats I can eat
that don't have maltitol in them. I think I found some jelly beans, but
I'll have to check the package again to be sure.
