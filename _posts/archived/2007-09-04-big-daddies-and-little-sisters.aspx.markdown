I basically spent the weekend [playing
*Bioshock*](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2007/08/16/bioshock-john-woos-stranglehold-overlord-and-other-demos.aspx),
which is a worthwhile endeavor by any standards.  Jenn worked on Monday,
so I had all day to spend running amongst the citizens of Rapture doing
damage and harvesting ADAM.

In all seriousness, if you haven't bought this game yet, just go out and
do it.  I think the last time I got so caught up in the plot of
something like this to the point of sort of surreal obssession was [the
first time I had a real-time *24*
marathon](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2004/10/11/24-in-less-than-20.aspx). 
I don't think I've ever been so caught up in a game.  (Yeah, [I'll take
a full week off for *Grand Theft
Auto*](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2002/11/18/time-on-my-hands-could-be-time-spent-with-you.aspx),
but it's not like I'm caught up in it like this.)  Even Jenn was caught
up just watching the thing.  She's started playing her own way through.

Once you finish - and you must finish - some things will happen that
make you feel a lot like the first time you saw *[The Sixth
Sense](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00004BZIY)*. 
You'll be all, "Holy crap, I can't believe I didn't see that!"  Not only
that, but choices you make during the game impact how things turn out. 
All of that makes it such that I'm actually going to play it through *a
second time* to pick up all the things I missed the first time around
and make different choices so I can see how things change.

I won't print any spoilers here because I've got a lot of friends
working through the game right now.  Suffice to say, I've got a new
high-water mark for games.  I don't know how they would do it, but if
they can whip out *Bioshock 2* or some other game just as immersive as
this, it'll be on the "buy" list.

I think the only thing I've been disappointed by with the game thus far
is the distinct lack of merchandise.  I want a *Bioshock* t-shirt and
they just don't exist.  That seems to be a pretty common desire, looking
at forums out there.  There was a Threadless contest and [they've got
some community-created
versions](http://www.threadless.com/submissions/designs,bioshock/showme,printed/thati,both),
but nothing official.  I wonder why [2K](http://www.2kgames.com) hasn't
stepped up to the plate on that.
