Friday night I became aware that my phone, a [Motorola
V180](http://direct.motorola.com/ENS/web_producthome.asp?Country=USA&language=ENS&productid=29308),
was able to *send* SMS messages (text messages), but I couldn't
*receive* them. An hour on the phone with Cingular got me to the
Motorola help desk where I found out that there's a known issue with the
V180 software. They discovered this in December, but somehow they didn't
notify anyone and I don't see it anywhere on their web site.

 To determine if you have the affected software, dial **\*\#9999\#** on
your phone. That will show you the version number (look for "S/W
Version"). The version on my phone right now is **R365\_G\_0B.D2.2ER**.
The important bit there is the **0B.D2.2ER** part - that's the version.
If you have **0B.D3.06R** or better, you're not affected by this
problem. If you have less than that, you will have issues with SMS
messages (both text and multimedia) as well as "other problems" that the
service person didn't bother listing off.

 How do you fix it? Well, in this day and age, with a phone that has a
USB link to it, you'd think you could just download the ROM from the web
site, hook the phone up, and update the software yourself. Not so. You
can either send your phone in and have them update the software for you
and send it back; or you can have them send you a replacement, you can
transfer your information over to the new one yourself, and then send in
your affected phone. Either way, they have to do the update at the
factory.

 That's one of the benefits of having this thing through work - I go
talk to our telecomm guy and the problem solves itself.
