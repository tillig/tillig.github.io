![Punchy! (7k

 I've been drinking altogether too much [Hawaiian
Punch](http://www.hawaiian-punch.com/) lately. I think that pretty much
any juice that's red is tasty. Like, fruit punch, cranberry juice,
raspberry juice, mixed berry juice... Love the red juice. I found that
Hawaiian Punch is cheap at the dollar store, so I stocked up and I'm
loving every minute of it. How can it be bad if it tastes so good?
