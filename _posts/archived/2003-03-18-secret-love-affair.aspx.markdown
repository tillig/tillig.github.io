I realized while on vacation - er, training - last week that I am having
an affair behind Jenn's back.

 It's true, and I'm coming clean about it right now.

 I have a love affair with my Playstation 2. It's an odd relationship
where I am both its sugar daddy and its bitch. I cannot help but to play
it, to buy more games for it, to give it its every need. When it calls
for me, I must go to it. I must find that last hidden package, perform
the entire set of unique tricks, get the ultimate weapon and/or destroy
the enemy. It is a moral imperative, and I am unable to resist its siren
call.

 So much so that I anxiously await the arrival of its distant cousin,
the [GBA SP](http://www.nintendo.com/systems/gba/gba_specs.jsp). I am
counting down the days until March 23, when the official Nintendo
release date has been set. I can hardly wait.
