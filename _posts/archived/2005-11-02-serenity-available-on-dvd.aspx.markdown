the best sci-fi movie I've seen in a looooong time, is now available for
pre-order at
Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BW7QWW/mhsvortex)
December 20th it's out. That's pretty quick, but I'm not going to
analyze it too much. I'm stoked to see it again, and in the comfort of
my own home. Buy two copies - it's that good.
