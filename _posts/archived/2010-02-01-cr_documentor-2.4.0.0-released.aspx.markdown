It's been almost a year, but I've finally got [the new
CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) out the door.
Several bug fixes and a couple of new features including:

-   Ability to "pause" rendering - "pause" the preview window and
    navigate around without having it update. Helpful if you're using
    the documentation preview as a reference while developing.
-   Assignable shortcut actions - set up shortcuts for many of the
    actions previously only available in the context menu like "convert
    selection to XML doc comment" or "collapse all XML documentation
    blocks."

Still free - head over to [check out the release
notes](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/wiki/VersionHistory) and
see all the changes or [just grab the latest
now](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/downloads/list).
