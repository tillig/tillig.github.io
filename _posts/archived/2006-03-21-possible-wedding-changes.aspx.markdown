We got the invoice for what the food will cost if we invite the full 125
people that we were going to and have all the hors d'oeuvres and such
the way we want. It comes to somewhere between "Seasonal Pricing" and
"\$CALL," so we're looking at possible amendments to things.
 
 We know we want that catering place because I don't want shitty wedding
food. I refuse to show up to my own reception and not want what's at the
buffet. I can do that at anyone else's wedding (sorry, all you people
whose weddings I've been to, but it's true - I can't do another "army
pan of teriyaki chicken"). So some changes have to be made.
 
 First, I think we'll cut slightly back on the food. If we nix the
butler-served hors d'oeuvres (you didn't all actually want the spinach
and artichoke dip on bruschetta or the crab cakes, did you?), that'll
save quite a bit, and there are some minor changes to the menu we might
be able to do (selecting a different beef dish, for example) to reduce
cost... but the largest way to reduce cost is to reduce head count.
 
 As such, we're going back over the list of potential invitees.
Generally speaking, family is safe... but friends we haven't seen in a
looooong time, really distant relatives, people who haven't actually met
one of us already... probably not going to make the list. I had a lot of
work people on the list, but I just can't afford it, so if I work with
you but you're not a) someone I hang out with weekends; b) a really good
friend from before I started Corillian; or c) in the wedding party... I
don't know you'll be getting an invite. Sorry. It's nothing personal.
 
 Instead, what we're toying with is a sort of open house deal where it's
a little less formal, possibly a week after the wedding (when we get
back from vacation), and that's where we'll invite all the people we
couldn't get before.
 
 Of course, that's all still being discussed, so this whole point might
be moot. We'll see. Jenn's going to run some more numbers and see how it
all comes out.
