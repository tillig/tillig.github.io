*Meeting Gibson*... that sounds sort of like the title for a play or an
art film. But it's not.
 
 My friend Colin sent me an email a couple of days ago mentioning that
William Gibson, author of the famed and revolutionary cyberpunk novel
[*Neuromancer*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441569595/mhsvortex),
will be [visiting the local Powell's City of Books on Sunday, February 9
at 7:30p](http://www.powells.com/calendar.html#gibson) to pimp his new
book, [*Pattern
Recognition*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399149864/mhsvortex).
 
 I'm considering going, but last time I went to see someone at Powell's
([Bruce Campbell](http://www.bruce-campbell.com/), for his
autobiography, [*If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-Movie
Actor*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312291450/mhsvortex)), I
got there two hours early and the line filled the entire top floor, went
down two flights of stairs, and filled half of the second floor. It was
ridiculous. I can only imagine the sort of crowd that William Gibson
will garner. That alone has me thinking that I probably won't. I'm not
much for standing in line for hours on end.
 
 William Gibson has apparently [started a blog this
month](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp), which I hope he
keeps up because it could prove out very interesting. I shall have to
keep tabs on that.
 
 Annoying user story of the day: There's this guy at work who seems to
have an inordinate number of problems lately. He's filed probably 10
help desk calls with us, and as it turns out several of those were
redundant in nature. I mean, if you can't access *any* network, chances
are you won't be able to access *any* web sites or other machines,
right? Does that mean you should file a help desk ticket for *each web
site you can't access*? Probably not. This guy did, though. Love that.
 
 So he files this help desk ticket because he doesn't have a certain
piece of software installed on his machine so certain things aren't
working properly. I'd handled a similar case earlier, so I sent him a
step-by-step list of how to fix the problem and install the software to
make things work. Later he calls me up and says he keeps getting these
error messages when he tries to follow my instructions. He's all, "I
keep getting this error when I do the last part of step one." So I ask
him what exactly he's done so far.
 
 "Well, first I did step three. Then I went back and did part of step
one, then step two, and now I'm finishing up step one."
 
 You know, I never realized that I would have to specify that *you need
to do the steps **in the order specified by the numbers***, but
apparently that's something I'll have to communicate. Numbered steps
just aren't clear enough.
