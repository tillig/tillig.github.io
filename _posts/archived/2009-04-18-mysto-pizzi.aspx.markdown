I won't lie - I'm a sucker for heavily produced electronic dance music.
[The new Lady GaGa
album](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IXSU8M?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001IXSU8M)
is in constant rotation at my house. If you're not into that sort of
thing, this post isn't for you.

If you are, though, I was surfing around and found Mysto & Pizzi - some
up and coming music producers. They do the remake of "Somebody's
Watching Me" that you might have heard in the background of a Geico
commercial. Anyway, if you're into this sort of thing, there are some
great tracks they've made available for free.

-   Geico will let you have [their version of "Somebody's Watching
    Me."](http://www.geico.com/about/commercials/music/)
-   Mysto & Pizzi have [a download
    page](http://www.mystoandpizzi.com/download/) with tracks from Kanye
    West, Britney Spears, and Beyonce.

And, like I said, free. Can't beat that.

Slightly off topic, but sort of not - I've noticed some of these newer
artists (like Lady GaGa and Mysto & Pizzi) going a different direction
with how they handle downloads and such. Like, when the Lady GaGa album
came out, it was the Amazon MP3 deal of the day for like \$5. Mysto &
Pizzi aren't putting crap tracks from some band you've never heard of
out there, they're putting out stuff from well-known artists. Free. And
you know how often I see stuff for these folks online and hear stuff
from my friends? *All the time.* It gets their music out there, gets the
names out there, and gets them fans... who will keep coming back, see
concerts, buy the merch, etc. Makes me wonder if they aren't onto
something here.
