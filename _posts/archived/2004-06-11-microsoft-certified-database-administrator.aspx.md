The end of [a long, long
journey](/archive/2003/02/20/continuous-plight-for-training.aspx) has
finally arrived.
 
 I took my last test today, [*MS070-228: Installing, Configuring, and
Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Enterprise
Edition*](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-228.asp), and
passed. I got a score of 854 (passing was 700) and from the look of the
results sheet, I think I only missed one question (they don't actually
tell you how many you got right or wrong, but you can sort of tell by
looking at these little graphs they give you that show your strengths
and weaknesses based on the questions you got right).
 
 That makes me a [Microsoft Certified Database
Administrator](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcdba/default.asp),
which, alongside my existing [Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer
for .NET](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcsd/default.asp)
certification, is pretty cool. It's been over a year in the making, and
it's finally come to fruition.
 
 Yay, me!
