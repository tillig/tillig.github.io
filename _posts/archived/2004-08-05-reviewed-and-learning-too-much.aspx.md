I had my annual performance review yesterday. It turned out well, but
they changed the review form this year so you have like 50 different
[redundant] essay questions to answer. When all was said and done, with
both my answers and my manager's answers to all the questions, the form
was 26 pages long in single-spaced 12 point Times New Roman.

 That's like a novel.

 When he put the finished form on the table in front of me, I thought it
was a magazine. It's huge. Crazy. I know the review process is in a
constant state of flux, so hopefully they'll flux a few of the
questions, at least the redundant ones, out. Yow.

 I'm still working on the stuff for the next version of
[Solvent](/archive/2004/06/25/solvent-power-toys-for-visual-studio-.net.aspx).
It's going to interact more with the Windows shell, though, which is all
low-level stuff, so I'm having to go back and re-learn C++ (and,
subsequently, the managed extensions to it) so I can interface my C\#
add-in code with the shell. It's turning out to be a lot more difficult
than I first anticipated, though, and I'm learning way too much about
how the shell does things (or doesn't, as the case may be) and the C++
required to mix managed and unmanaged C++. I've had a couple of people
at work look at it and they've offered some general help/direction, but
no concrete examples or solutions. I'm even considering [farming it
out](http://www.rentacoder.com). I'll be glad when it's done.
