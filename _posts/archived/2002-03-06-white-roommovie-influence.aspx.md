A quick anecdote to start us off: I've been drinking a lot of water
today, but the last time I went to the soda fountain here at work to get
some water, I decided to get a little [Coke](http://www.cocacola.com/)
instead, just for a change. Without even thinking about it, I looked at
the machine and said, out loud, "Gimme some sugar, baby." I didn't
realize what I had even said until a few seconds after I had gotten my
beverage. It's sad to think that [some
movies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001ODHJ/mhsvortex) can
have such an influence on your daily life.

 Speaking of movies, every time my friend Aarron listens to the album
*[The White
Room](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002VMN/mhsvortex)* by
The KLF, he always mentions that it says on the back something about
this being the soundtrack to the KLF movie of the same name. Then Aarron
says that he'd love to see that movie.

 Up until the other day, I always thought that was just a marketing
gimmick. Apparently, though, [it *really was* a
movie](ftp://ftp.xmission.com/pub/users/l/lazlo/music/klf/etc/klf-script-thewhiteroom.txt).
From skimming stuff like the [KLF
FAQ](ftp://ftp.xmission.com/pub/users/l/lazlo/music/klf/klf-faq-199703.txt),
it looks like they started making the movie, but it ended up never
coming out. Sounds like if you pursue it enough and find the right folks
out there, some of them have portions of the movie in fourth- or
fifth-generation quality that you can see. I didn't go that far. But it
sounds interesting.
