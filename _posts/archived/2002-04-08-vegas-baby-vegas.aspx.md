Jenn and I are confirmed for the long-needed Vegas trip. Four days and
three nights in the [Paris Las Vegas](http://www.parislasvegas.com),
courtesy of [Southwest Airlines Vacations](http://www.swavacations.com).
A big tip of the hat to SWA - they are *by far* the most affordable way
to go. Plus, the flight attendants have always had good senses of humor
when I've flown and that makes the trip that much more enjoyable. If
you're gonna go, check with them first.

 I can hardly wait. I've already got the time off approved, I've got the
plane, hotel, and rental car booked, and I'm counting down the days
until May 14, when we leave first thing in the morning.
