Ever since we moved into our place we've thought about getting an
irrigation system. The yard is oddly shaped in front (we're on a corner
lot) and there are some pretty inconveniently located parking strips
that need to be tended to. That nets out to a lot of frustration running
around moving sprinklers and a spotty lawn - green in the parts that
it's convenient to water, dead in the parts you "just can't reach."

 I'm not sure what financial genius decided that the year we're getting
married is also the year we should get a sprinkler system (probably me),
but that's exactly what we did. We contracted with [Dennis' Seven
Dees](http://www.sevendees.com/) to get this done, after getting several
quotes. We weren't disappointed.

 From the second they got there, you could tell they knew exactly what
they were doing. It took them about a week from start to finish, and
aside from the spots where they re-seeded and mulched to replace the
grass from the trenches (it's too hot to lay down sod - it'd die), you
can't even tell they were here.

 Here's a backyard panorama of the trenches in place (click for a larger

 Pretty crazy. Then here's the finished backyard (click for a larger

 Not too shabby, eh?

 I've also got to compliment them on their service. At every step, they
had everything totally under control. Permits with the city, getting
utilities marked, scheduling when things had to be done... everything
was totally taken care of, and that gave me a lot of confidence in
them.

 Anyway, I'm stoked. No more manual lawn watering, so hopefully this
thing will green up a bit. I'm glad I went with these guys and would
totally recommend them to anyone looking for landscape work. We'll be
using them for winterization of the system and probably for any future
yard-related stuff we need done.
