I woke up this morning 10 minutes before my alarm went off because a guy
in my dream shot me in the nuts with a silenced .22 semi-automatic
pistol.

 I really should probably stop reading spy novels.

 Ahem.

 Today, as many may know, is [Sysadmin Appreciation
Day](http://www.sysadminday.com/).

 And let me say that I have the *coolest boss ever*, because he got me a
$50 gift certificate to [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com) in honor
of said day.

 So I clicked over to my [ThinkGeek Wish
List](http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/gimme.cgi?wid=81cdf622d) and
ordered myself up a
[SoundBug](http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/computing/5a15.shtml) and a
cool [SQL t-shirt](http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/apparel/595d.shtml).
I'm stoked.

 I pulled out yet another *nice, chilly beverage* from the *refrigerator
under my desk* this morning. I cannot stress the convenience I've found
in such a thing. I really need to get some running water and a microwave
in here.

 I still haven't decided what I should get with the money from the
[other fridge](/archive/2002/07/24/the-cue.aspx). I figure I've got
about $80 to work with, so I could get lots of small things - DVDs,
CDs, etc. - or I could get one big thing. I'm leaning towards one big
thing. But what? Options include...
-   [Ottawa Senators home
    jersey](http://shop.nhl.com/itmModelList.asp?s={2652B09B-A8F3-4F79-AE65-C35B857C07D3}&l=1&a=10088&c=8036&sf=2&cnl=3&i=10279)
-   [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice
    City*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000696CZ/mhsvortex)
    (preorder) - I'd actually probably get this at Software Etc. at the
    mall because you can preorder and get a free strategy guide with it
-   The big [Alphonse Mucha
    book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300074190/mhsvortex)
    I've been looking at
-   A [glare screen](http://www.glareshield.com/tvfilter.html) for my
    television (the glare on our TV is *awful*)
-   A hooker (okay, I was kidding about that one, but I had to make sure
    you were still paying attention)
-   A [Cost Plus World Market](http://www.costplus.com/) shopping spree
    (which would last about six seconds because I like all the expensive
    stuff in there)



 I'm just not sure. I'm sort of an impulse shopper, so I don't know what
I want until I walk through the store and see it. I'm leaning towards
the Senators jersey, though. You can never have enough hockey jerseys.
Stylish *and* comfortable.

 I think I will go this weekend to see the [new Austin Powers
movie](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0295178). I've heard a lot of good
things about it, so I'm hoping it's as funny as it sounds. I crack up
every time I see the preview where Austin is staring at Fred Savage's
mole. "MOLE! Moleymoleymoleymoleymoley...." It just never gets old.

 I still haven't seen [*Men In Black
2*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120912) yet. I heard it wasn't all that
and a bag of chips, so I guess I'll wait for it to hit the
[Bagdad](http://www.mcmenamins.com/Edge/thsched.html) and then go see it
for three bucks.
