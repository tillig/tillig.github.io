[*Serenity* came out on DVD
yesterday.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BW7QWW/mhsvortex)
If you haven't gotten your copy yet, why not?

 I got mine, but only after a bit of a struggle. I went to Target at
lunch and they had *already sold out*. Granted, they were selling it for
$16.99, which is a pretty good deal on a new movie, so I can't argue
it. Plus, it was an awesome movie, so I'm glad to see it went well...
but that doesn't get a copy in my grubby little hands, does it?

 Luckily Jenn went to Costco and was able to pick up a copy there for
$18.99. That's fine; I'll eat the $2. That bad boy's getting watched
this weekend.
