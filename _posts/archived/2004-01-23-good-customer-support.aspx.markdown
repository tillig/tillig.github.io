I generally loathe having to contact any customer support organization
for any reason because I know I'm going to have to *get into it* with
whoever I get ahold of to try and get something to happen that will
alleviate whatever problem it is that I'm having.
 
 I've gotta say, though, that I've been in touch with both
[Sony](http://www.us.playstation.com/support.aspx) and
[Namco](http://www.namco.com/support/) on customer support issues
recently and both of them had *outstanding* customer service.
 
 In Sony's case, I made my primary contact over the phone, and the
operators I spoke to were very helpful - they didn't make me go through
all of these ridiculous procedures, they talked to me to ascertain my
level of knowledge with the product and when they determined that I
didn't need to do the "beginner" stuff, I was pushed through to the
proper level of support. That's awesome - do you know how long it takes
to get to a *real* tech at Microsoft?
 
 In Namco's case, they have *live online support* so rather than waiting
for an operator on hold, you're instantly connected to a support person
in an online chat scenario. It took me all of two minutes to get an RMA
\# for an item I needed to exchange, and I just now went in and used
that service to check the status of the RMA. With a *real, live person*.
No 24-hour-turnaround-time, no automated response.
 
 I think if I'm ever in charge of a support organization, I'm going to
use those as examples of the *right* way to do things. That doesn't
imply that the customer is always right, by any means, but the
responsive nature of the service and easy manner in which the correct
service was retrieved is invaluable.
