I went in this morning to get the estimate on the damage from the
[sideswipe on Friday](/archive/2002/12/09/crash.aspx). [The body shop
guy](http://www.chrisandjohnsautobody.com/) looked at it, noticed that
it spread from one panel (my rear bumper) onto a second panel (I got
nicked on the rear driver's side panel, too) and let out a low whistle.
I didn't find that a good sign. My tail light on the driver's side was
also cracked.

 In the end, the repair cost tallied up to **\$1067.38**. Thank goodness
for insurance, is all I have to say. The tail light alone cost like
\$200 to replace.

 I'll take it in Monday to have them start work on it. I'll be getting a
rental car, which is good. [Last time I had to get my car
fixed](/archive/2002/03/04/punk-bitch-keyers.aspx) I ended up driving
[The Babemobile](/archive/2002/03/07/the-babemobile.aspx) (which has
since been sold off). I can only hope I don't end up in some stupid Ford
Escort.
