Pizza delivery may not be lucrative, but it's one of the ten best jobs
available. If you think there's something out there that nobody's done,
you're wrong. "More" is not necessarily "better." The drapes don't
always have to match the carpet. Any innocent sentence can be twisted
into sexual innuendo. They teach more than they let on in Catholic
all-girls schools. My medical insurance doesn't cover the right kind of
sponge baths. Some women actually *do* like sex. "Sexual Healing" is a
legitimate thing. The boobs are always bigger on the other side of the
fence (or something like that). Anybody can make a web site - *anybody*.
Regardless of what you're into, there's always someone into something
*weirder*. If variety is the spice of life, the Internet is very spicy.
Skin stretches. I don't have enough drive space. The guy who invented
the pop-up advertisement needs to be shot. Be proud of what you look
like - cosmetic surgery doesn't always improve things.
