CodeRush (and Refactor! Pro) from DevExpress are my Visual Studio
add-ins of choice. They're based on the "DXCore" engine, which makes
writing your own Visual Studio add-ins a breeze.

DevExpress has [released a free version of their CodeRush tool called
"CodeRush Xpress"](http://devexpress.com/crx) for users of Visual Studio
2008. It includes 60+ refactorings as well as a host of additional
helpful functionality. If you have not treated yourself to trying these
amazing tools, this is a great way to give it a run - **huge value, no
cost to you**.

Once you fall in love with it, check out other plugins that are
available - also free - like
[CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) and the [DXCore
Community Plugins](http://dxcorecommunityplugins.googlecode.com).
