The television repair guy came to my house and it turns out I need a new
tube put in the TV. The offical diagnosis was "unable to hold purity -
purity slips out of alignment." My diagnosis is "colors fucked up,
picture not straight." Regardless, it needs a new tube. Next step is
that they'll call me to schedule a pickup time.
