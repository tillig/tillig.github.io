So I decided to go to Burger King for one of their tasty
under-three-dollar cheeseburger meals today for lunch. I'm sitting,
getting ready to turn left, when I notice something happen that probably
should not have happened.
 
 See, the street I'm turning left from has two lanes going in each
direction and a single left-hand turn lane down the center. Like a lot
of streets around here. I'm sitting in the left hand turn lane when I
see this lady in a minivan pull up next to me on my left-hand side.
 
 For the folks not from the US or those not really paying attention,
that means she pulled up and stopped in *an oncoming traffic lane*. And
she's just sitting there, not really paying any attention to anything. I
turn and look at her, horrified, and she looks around like a dazed panda
and then looks back at me and gives me that "whoopsie!" shrug that
moronic drivers give you when they know they've done something wrong but
are too stupid to do anything about it.
 
 Still flabbergasted, I watch as *four or five more cars line up behind
her*. Like lemmings, ready to file off the edge of the cliff, they line
up in *oncoming traffic*.
 
 Meanwhile, the oncoming traffic has seen that there are morons in the
way, so the largest traffic jam in the history of traffic jams proceeds
to set in. Especially not helpful in a place where the lights only let
like four or five cars through before changing again.
 
 My light finally changed, so I went, and eventually I see her *run the
red* (because she made no motion to go while the light was green - no
signal or anything) into the oncoming traffic.
 
 Sometimes I wish they would genetically engineer some sort of plague to
kill off all the stupid people. The people sitting in oncoming traffic?
Yeah, those are the people who call me up asking for technical support.
Society, the welfare system, and yours truly don't need those people
clogging up the earth like shit in a drainpipe, needing to be plunged.
