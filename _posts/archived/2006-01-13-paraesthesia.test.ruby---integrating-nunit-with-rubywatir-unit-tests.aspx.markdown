Testing ASP.NET web applications can be a painful process. Wouldn't it
be nice to have a unit testing framework that covered both the API and
the web UI testing in an integrated fashion?
 
 I put up a CodeProject article discussing how to integrate the NUnit
test framework for API unit testing with the Ruby/Watir test framework
for web UI testing so you can run all of your tests from one spot and
see all the results aggregated. (Note: the test execution mechanism
doesn't actually involve NUnit proper, so it can be applied to other
similar testing frameworks like the VS 2005 test suite - just use the VS
2005 test method/fixture attributes rather than the NUnit ones; no
change to the Ruby/Watir test executor needed!)
