![Sporting the family
colors]({{ site.url }}/images/20041123sashirt.jpg)I
got my [San Andreas
shirt](http://store.yahoo.com/rockstarwarehouse/sanandreastee.html)
delivered yesterday, and I'm proudly sporting it today. Didn't hurt *at
all* that it came with two six-inch-square San Andreas logo stickers and
[an 18-inch-square San Andreas
kerchief]({{ site.url }}/images/20041123sakerchief.jpg).
It is, for lack of a better word, *the bomb*. Had I known all the extra
stuff came with it, I'd have ordered sooner.
