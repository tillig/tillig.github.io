I have this mug that a friend at work got me for Christmas. It's a nice
mug, but over the weekend I had a couple of problems with it.
 
 First, it's one of those mugs that can't go in the dishwasher because
of the way it's insulated - water can get between the outer layer of
plastic and the inner layer of metal and mess up the design that
displays on the mug.
 
 I took the mug home and put water in the mug and set it in the sink.
No, the sink was not filled with water - it was just sitting there. Dry
sink, mug full of water. By the end of the weekend, I was going to wash
it but somehow water has gotten between the plastic and metal on the mug
and has soaked down half of the design inside. So much for that.
 
 Second, there's something weird and stinky inside this mug. I've washed
it over and over, using different types of soap, really hot water, cold
water, you name it. It smells like sour-washcloth-meets-coffee. I can't
figure out what's up with it. I have to drink with the lid on it because
otherwise it's... well, it's just *bad*. I have no idea what it is.
