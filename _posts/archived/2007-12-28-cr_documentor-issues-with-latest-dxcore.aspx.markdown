I've uncovered some issues with
[CR\_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
where the context menu doesn't appear when you upgrade your DXCore to
version 3.0.5. I will do my best to resolve this issue and any other
known defects in the next release, which, I assure you, is
forthcoming... just sort of slowly. But it's coming!

I've posted the list of known issues [on the CR\_Documentor
page](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
for now.
