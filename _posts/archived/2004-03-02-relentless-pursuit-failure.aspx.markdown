Jenn and I went to three different houses this past weekend to see if
there was anything worth buying.
 
 There wasn't.
 
 The first house was far too small with poor use of space. Good
condition, nice neighborhood, but that's about the limit. The second and
third houses were *beautiful* but were backed right up against a major
road. Standing outside, I could barely hear what Jenn was saying
standing five feet away. Crazy.
 
 Thus, as usual, the search continues. I've been at this for a month now
and, aside from the one that got away, I've got nothing. A little
disheartening, but even more generally annoying. I'm in for the long
haul.
