I have to admit an addiction to the game [SSX:
Tricky](http://www.ea.com/easportsbig/games/ssxtricky/home.jsp) for the
[PS2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RT08/mhsvortex). It
is what is commonly referred to as *the bomb*.
 
 That said, not only does the game have addictive play, but also the
music kicks a lot of ass. So I went to the local
[Wherehouse](http://www.wherehousemusic.com/) and picked up a copy of
the
[soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y1YG/mhsvortex).
It rocks, but I have to say, I'm a little irritated that it's not, like,
a two-disc set with *all* the music on it. Further, I particularly
wanted to hear the music that plays during the little movie of the
"Eddie" character dancing. Unfortunately, it's not on that CD. I guess
I'll have to do a little research.
 
 I discovered a [PS2 mod chip](http://www.gamegizmo.com/v5mod.html) that
doesn't require soldering, but it still requires that I take the machine
apart. I'm reluctant to do that, but I'm still considering it since you
don't have to actually permanently modify the PS2 itself.
