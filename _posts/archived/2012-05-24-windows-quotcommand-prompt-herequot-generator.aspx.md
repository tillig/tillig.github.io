**I love context menu "command prompt here" shortcuts.** Every time a
new VS version comes out, or a different prompt is available that I
need, I create a new one.

In the past, [I've tried to maintain a whole roundup of current
versions](/archive/2007/11/20/command-prompt-here-round-up.aspx), but
that's been tough. Different operating systems come out, I need to tweak
this or that to make things work, and I end up having to edit and
re-package the whole bundle. It's also a pain for people wanting the
installers – you want some, but not all; the tool isn't quite what you
want but you're not sure what to tweak; and so on.

**Today all of that stops.**

Rather than maintain separate little .INF files for every command prompt
type, **I've created a**[**Command Prompt Here
Generator**](http://app.paraesthesia.com/CommandPromptHere/). Using a handy little
wizard interface, you can select from a list of command prompts that I
know about. After that, you can optionally tweak the values. Want a
different path? Fix it. Want the display text tweaked? Make it so. At
the end, you can download a fully customized, generated installer for
the prompt of your dreams.

Try it out, let me know what you think. If you want a new prompt added,
you'll need to let me know the info on the prompt (look at the
"customize" screen in the wizard – that's the info I need to know). Find
a bug, drop me a line.
