I thought about this the other day when Jenn and I were shopping in the
perfume section of [Nordstrom](http://www.nordstrom.com/)...
 
 People make associations in their brains. Like the way people remember
the words to a song based on how the song sounds - the rhythm, the
melody, etc. In some cases, people use songs and rap as a sort of
mnemonic device to help themselves remember stuff. A popular example of
this is the [*Schoolhouse
Rock*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKTY/mhsvortex)
series. Hey, that's how I learned the preamble to the Constitution.
 
 It's also pretty well known that people can remember thousands of
different scents. Who doesn't know the smell of chocolate or coffee?
 
 So what if people started exploiting the ability to remember smells and
exercise that to help in remembering things? I'm not sure how that would
work exactly, but the ability to do something like, "Hmmm... spearmint.
That reminds me that the Wright brothers made the first airplane." Or
something like that.
 
 I think scratch-and-sniff stickers would become popular again. People
in classes would start carrying around these huge sticker notebooks and
be madly scratching at stickers during tests. Schools would have to
start pumping out a sort of smell neutralizer to stop kids from
cheating.
 
 Might be interesting.
