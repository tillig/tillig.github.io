[![Clearification](https://hyqi8g.dm1.livefilestore.com/y2p2tL0IU-GreV8aLGL71N2lAcXAQBecWLV-uiSXAZoCpV--1UgEaZnyE-LHoUynW7C-I2F4aZ6PCg_PzkCzkV-XDVtwgcmoxWkrhxNJnESb8M/20061215clearification.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.clearification.com/)I'm
really not sure [what this is](http://www.clearification.com/) - if it's
some sort of "viral marketing campaign" that I'm not smart enough to
get, or just some experimental thing - but it's tied to Microsoft
Windows Vista somehow and it's intriguing. There are these episodes
telling the story of this guy, Demetri, and his odd psychological
issues. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but I will. How can I
not?
