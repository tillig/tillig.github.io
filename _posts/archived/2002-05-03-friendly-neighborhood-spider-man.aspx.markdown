[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 11]
 
 Well, as everyone knows,
[Spider-Man](http://www.spiderman.sonypictures.com/) is out today. And,
yeah, I wanna see it. I wasn't so hot on it the very first time I saw
the preview, but as I saw more about it, it grew on me. Then when I saw
that, true to style, Sam Raimi stuck [his
car](http://www.freep.com/entertainment/movies/evil18_20020218.htm) in
there, I was sucked in. (I should have figured the car would be there,
it's *always* there, but seeing it made me happy.)
 
 As such, I'm wearing my Spider-Man shirt today, even though I wore it
on Monday (yes, it's clean), and I'm really tempted to head down to Toys
R Us and get some of the web-shooting gloves so I can combine them into
one, cooler-than-cool Spider-Toy. I really shouldn't spend the money on
it, but it's *so cool*. Besides, I'm starting to get that "it's only
money" feeling anymore.
 
 Then again, I really do need to save up so I have a reasonable down
payment for a house. I'd like to get out of apartment living ASAP since
I'm tired of my neighbors downstairs cooking some sort of *stew* that
smells like sour tomato sauce. The stench filters upstairs into our
bedroom and makes it difficult to sleep. I'm also tired of the
four-year-old next door yelling at his mom at 2:00am about how he *can't
find his underpants*.
 
 I just heard on [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/) that [The
Osbournes](http://www.mtv.com/onair/osbournes/) may be renewing for
another season. Apparently, this season they *only* got *\$200,000* for
making the show; next season they may get upwards of *\$20,000,000*.
One-hundred times as much. Somehow, while I'm not the guy paying the
money, that makes me a little irritated. How come I don't get \$20mil to
have someone run around filming my daily life? (Probably because the
fortieth day of me sitting on my ass at work would get a little old.) I
guess it goes to prove that some folks just have too much money.
 
 For those who are bored: The "[Poke Alex In The
Eye](http://www.pokealexintheeye.com/main.php)" game has been updated.
And for those who've never been there, you'll also want to check out
