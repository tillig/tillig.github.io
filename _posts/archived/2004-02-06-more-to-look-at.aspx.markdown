I've finally received a new batch of 34 properties to look at from my
realtor. Based on location and features, I've narrowed it down to 8, and
that includes the two that Jenn and I already agreed we wanted to see.
We may narrow it down further; I've let a couple slide through that are
slightly farther south than what we want, but they're in brand new
neighborhoods, so we'll see. I know I may be opening myself up for
something bad neighborhood-wise, which is not going to fly.
 
 We'll look at those online tonight and then tomorrow when we see the
realtor we'll tell him which ones we're interested in. I don't want to
spend all damn day driving around willy-nilly - I'm very much a
get-in-get-out sort of person.
 
 I'll have to remember to measure the TV so we can see where it might go
in some of these places.
