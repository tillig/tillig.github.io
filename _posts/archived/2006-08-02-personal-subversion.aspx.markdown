[Lifehacker has a nice article on setting up a personal home Subversion
server.](http://lifehacker.com/software/subversion/hack-attack-how-to-set-up-a-personal-home-subversion-server-188582.php)
You can store your repository locally or on a server - the article
addresses both.
 
 I use CVS in a local repository to store my project code, but at work
we use Subversion and I'm enjoying the flexibility. I may have to switch
over to a local Subversion.
