I, as well as the majority of the geek population, love the movie
[*Blade Runner*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/). Love it.
 
 The thing is, though, when I fell in love with it, I fell in love with
the original theatrical version - the one with the voice-over and
modified "happy ending." The *Blade Runner* purists will argue that
wasn't as good, that the [Director's
Cut](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0790729628/mhsvortex) was
much better as it stuck closer to [Ridley
Scott's](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/) original vision. That's all
fine and good, but it's akin to fighting over who the best James Bond
was - generally speaking, you're going to like the Bond whose movies you
saw first. (I'm for [Pierce
Brosnan](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000112/), but I used to be a [Roger
Moore](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000549/) man. Alas, that's another
blog entry.) I liked the voice-over. I liked the happy ending. I thought
the Deckard-is-a-replicant thing was dumb. I thought the unicorn thing
was dumb.
 
 (And for the record, no version was like [the
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345404475/mhsvortex), so
we won't even go there.)
 
 The problem is, they only released the Director's Cut on DVD. If you
want to see the original version, you have to go to Blockbuster and rent
the one copy of the videotape that they have and try to watch it in its
half-demagentized state (if someone hasn't just stolen the tape
altogether).
 
 My problems are solved. [According to Sci Fi
Wire](http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=36328), they're going
to press a new DVD with a remastered version of the original Director's
Cut; create a new Director's Cut (the "Final Cut"), release that to
theaters in 2007; and issue a special-edition DVD after that with *three
versions* of the film: remastered Director's Cut, expanded international
theatrical version, *and original theatrical version*.
 
 My day just got made.
