Saturday was spent in Woodland, WA, touring the [Empress
Palace](http://www.empresspalace.com), a location that Jenn and I ended
up reserving for our wedding.

 It's a beautiful place, currently decorated for the holiday season,
and, frankly, we couldn't beat the price for what we got. Paying up
front got us a 10% discount, and Jenn won a drawing for another $500
off.

 The date's set for October 14, 2006. I'm sure we'll have plenty to fill
our time between now and then, but at least the venue (for both the
ceremony and reception) is settled.
