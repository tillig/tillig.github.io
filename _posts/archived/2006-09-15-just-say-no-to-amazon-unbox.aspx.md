Amazon has this new "video on demand" service called "Amazon Unbox." For
about a second it looked interesting - get digital versions of movies
rather than buying DVDs - until you look at the license agreement you
have to accept to get these movies.
 
 [There's a great write-up of this at Boing
Boing.](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/09/15/amazon_unbox_to_cust.html)
 
 I think I'll be passing on the old Amazon Unbox.
