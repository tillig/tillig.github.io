After playing [San
Andreas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001VGFK2/mhsvortex)
this long, I've grown somehow fond of the 90's hip hop/rap they've put
in as the soundtrack.

 That, of course, has somehow turned me on to Snoop Dogg, who's
[greatest hits
album](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004SCDQ/mhsvortex) I
purchased because a couple of the songs are in the game.

 Now, while I fancy myself a 'gangsta' in the game world, I am a
computer programmer/nerd/geek, so you have to take my altogether
far-too-caucasian stylings with a grain of salt. That said, I never
really paid attention to what Snoop was saying with his songs, I just
grooved to them.

 After listening to the songs without playing the game simultaneously
(i.e., in the car), I've discovered the ultimate lyrical insight that
Snoop Dogg provides.

 Snoop's songs are primarily about one or more of three very important
topics:

- Snoop Dogg
- Weed
- Bitches

 Listening to Snoop Dogg has taught me several life lessons. For
example, when smoking a joint, [you're only supposed to take two puffs,
then pass it
on](http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/snoopdog/rhythm/pass_it.snp.txt).
I've also definitely confirmed that Snoop Dogg's name is, in fact, Snoop
Dogg. [Have no doubt about
it](http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/snoopdog/dogstyle/who_am_i.snp.txt).

 These valuable life lessons come to us through such insightful lyrics
as "[I'm the capital S, I don't f--- with stress, N double O-P D-O
muthaf---in double
G](http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/snoopdog/gamesold/still_a.snp.txt)."
Just in case, you know, you weren't aware of how to spell "Snoop Dogg."

 In all reality, though, I have to look at this stuff the same way I
look at [Marilyn Manson](http://www.marilynmanson.com/): It's
entertainment - all part of the show. It's so *blatantly* politically
incorrect it makes me laugh, like a [Chris Rock comedy
concert](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00026L9BQ/mhsvortex) or
pretty much anything by [Denis
Leary](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005IKZ/mhsvortex). You
can't help but laugh.

 Especially when, after all that, you see Snoop Dogg on a T-Mobile
commercial asking advice about fabric softener from Wayne Newton. Too
funny.
