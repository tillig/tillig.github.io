I've been working on tracking down different assemblies' strong naming
information this morning and I've decided that `sn -T [assemblyname]` is
a big pain in the rear, so I threw together an app I'm sure is out there
plentifully already yet I couldn't be bothered to search for. If it's
out there, great. If it's not, here you go.
 
 This utility is a simple Windows forms app that allows you to drag a
.NET assembly onto it and view the strong name information about it.Â 
You can copy/paste any of the information directly, plus I even threw in
a little thing that will generate a sample binding redirect you can put
in your app.config file.

 I wouldn't want them to just put this in the properties on the assembly
or anything.
