I took [my
car](http://www.acura.com/model_types/rsx_types/types_rsx_index.asp) in
to the shop to [get the key scratch
fixed](/archive/2002/03/04/punk-bitch-keyers.aspx) today. I'm not sure
when it'll be done. I hope it will be soon, because instead of my car
(which I love), I'm driving *The Babemobile*.
 
 The Babemobile earned its name because that is precisely what it is
*not*. It's a 1988(?) Plymouth Voyager. There are several issues with
it:
-   It's a 4 cylinder engine. In a minivan. Floor it, and it *might* go
    50mph. *Downhill, with a tailwind.*
-   The hood is rusting through, which gives the paint a nice, *abused*
    patina.
-   It shoots *black smoke* out of the tailpipe. I tried to convince
    myself that it was just a camouflaging device, similar to the ink
    that squids shoot at predators. But then when Scotty called up from
    the engine room ["She can't take much more of
    this!"](http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/2667/star_trek_sex_lines.htm)
    I knew it was all just a lie.
-   It turns like a [wounded
    tugboat](http://www.freecoolpages.com/surfcity/towboat/tugboat.htm).
    I've taken to calling out directions in terms of "port" and
    "starboard."
-   *Everything* on it is *loose*. As you drive, the whole van chatters
    and squeaks like a small herd of lab rats.


 
 That's not a comprehensive list by any means, but you get the idea.
 
 Anyway, all that totals up to is that I really just want my car back so
we can donate this thing to the [Humane Society](http://www.hsus.org/)
or something. Maybe that \$500 can feed some
[kitties](http://www.hsus.org/ace/13315) or something.
 
 I suppose I shouldn't complain. If the van didn't exist, I'd be renting
a car right now, which *costs money*. Free is [negligibly] better than
not free.
