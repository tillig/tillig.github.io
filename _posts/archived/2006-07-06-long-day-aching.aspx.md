It's going to be a long day today. I am every shade of aching, from my
head down to the small of my back. I can type well enough, which is
good, but I can't write because I can't frickin' grip anything. Just
goes to show how much of a desk jockey I am, that [the fireworks show on
the fourth](/archive/2006/07/05/fireworks-and-wastewater-treatment.aspx)
took it out of me that badly. In my defense, it *is* a lot of hard work.
I normally don't go out digging trenches and whatnot.

 I'm also vastly undercaffeinated, so it's time to fire up the ol'
Mountain Dew train and get on board.

 [Greg](http://www.greghughes.net) was awesome enough to get Jenn and I
some [Western Display Fireworks](http://www.westerndisplay.com/) crew
shirts so we'll look all official next time we're working (Western is
who we do the shows for).

 ![Big Cheese of the South
Seas]({{ site.url }}/images/20060706pearlcluster.jpg)In
other news, I have been playing [Hexic on Xbox
360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/hexichdlivearcadexbox360/) and
finally got a black pearl cluster, giving me 20 pride-filled
Gamerpoints. It's been a long time in the works getting there, so I'm
pretty stoked. You should have seen the [pain-ridden] victory dance last
night.
