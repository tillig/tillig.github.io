Well, I've finally finished the conversion of my web site from the old
"MHS Vortex" style to the new, improved "paraesthesia" weblog style. The
[Gen<sup>13</sup>](/gen13/) section has pretty much gone the way of the dodo,
though I've left the last version of the links and collector's info
pages up there so folks coming in can still refer to them if they really
want to. The "tributes" sections are gone, too, since they really never
got updated or anything. Hopefully you can just read about what I'm into
or whatever in the blog.
 
 Oh, and "AssKick!", as awesome of an idea as it was, is also gone.
 
 I'm also pleased to announce that, in related news, I have MUCH more
free space on my account now that all of that stuff is gone. Maybe now I
can post some more interesting and changing items in the coming times.
