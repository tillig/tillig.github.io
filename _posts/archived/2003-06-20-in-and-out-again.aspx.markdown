I got my car back from the body shop and I'm once again in business.
It's nice to have my own car back; that rental was a piece of shit.
 
 Jenn's talking to me while I'm typing this, and let me tell you how
hard it is to concentrate on BOTH things at the same time. Smile and
nod, Trav, smile and nod. I just told her that it was hard to do this
and legitimately listen at the same time and I'm getting the feeling
that she's pissed off about it. Can't win for losing, man.
 
 Just so you all know, I'm out of town next week for training - Windows
apps in C\# - so I probably won't be posting but will hopefully have a
play-by-play from the class. And I'll try to make it more exciting than
last time.
