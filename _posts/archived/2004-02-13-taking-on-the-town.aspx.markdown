I'm not sure if it's a sign of my age or distinct lack of energy, but
Jenn's friends at work invited us out to go clubbing tonight and I was
all for it until I heard they wanted to meet up *at 11:00p*. Dude, I'm
ready for *bed* at 11:00p. I'm all about meeting up at 8 and going from
there.
 
 My eBay auctioning has been reasonably successful. I'm finding that
generally I need to list things for two weeks, but after that they're
sold. The default listing of a single week doesn't seem to work. It's
like people specifically wait for me to pay the extra \$0.35 to relist
the item before deciding to bid on it. At least the stuff's selling.
 
 I've got a lot of stuff to do at work, but I'm really just not
interested in any of it, so I'm finishing up little nickel-and-dime
things that fall through the cracks. The three-day weekend is coming up
and I'm not only anxious to get to that, but also kind of excited to go
house shopping. One in particular has caught my eye.
 
 In other news, I've converted Jenn over to be a [Homestar
Runner](http://www.homestarrunner.com/) fan. She used to just not
understand the whole [Strong
Bad](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html) thing, but I bought
[the CD](http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/stbadsicd.html) and she's
hooked. Now she goes and regularly checks for Strong Bad emails just
like the rest of the intelligent universe. Her favorite character is
[The Cheat](http://www.homestarrunner.com/vcr_cheat.html). I think she
may need a [Cheat
shirt](http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/cheat.html).
