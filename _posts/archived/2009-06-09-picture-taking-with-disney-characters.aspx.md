I'm not sure what made me think of this story, but it made me snicker to
myself so I thought I'd tell it.

Back in October of last year, [Jenn and I went to
Disneyland](/archive/2008/10/21/disneylandlegoland-vacation.aspx). One
of the days we were there, we were wandering around in [California
Adventure](http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/landing?name=DisneysCaliforniaAdventureLandingPage)
checking out the Pixar attractions and we found a really neat cut-out of
Wall-E that you could take your picture with. As we headed over to see
it, one of the myriad photographers in the park approached.

"Would you like to get your picture with-"

"Wall-E?" I interrupted.

"-Frollo?" the photographer finished, and motioned to a character
standing a few feet away.

I had to think fast on this one. To be honest, I didn't know who Frollo
was, but since the actor was standing not too far off, I kind of felt
bad. I mean, regardless of who Frollo is, it didn't look like he was [as
popular as a Jack
Sparrow](http://www.lamag.com/featuredarticle.aspx?id=7016&source=rss),
for example. And how totally offensive would it be that the tourists
would rather have their picture taken with a plywood cut-out than with
you, the actual costumed character, live in the park?

"AND Frollo, *of course*," I replied.

We headed over to the Wall-E cut-out, got our pictures there, and then
over to Frollo, and got some additional photos. As we walked away, I had
to ask Jenn, since we hadn't consulted on this. "Who the fuck is
Frollo?"

"I have absolutely no clue," she said. We peeked behind us to get a
second look at the character. Nope, no idea whatsoever. Didn't even look
remotely familiar.

It was only later in the day when we finally looked him up online.
Apparently [Frollo is the bad guy from *The Hunchback of Notre
Dame*](http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/frollo/frollo.html).
Can't say I've seen that one, even to this day.

It makes me wonder if that's sort of punishment or something for the
character actors there. "Piss us off, and we'll suit you up as a
partly-known character from one of the less popular films! That'll show
you!" Or are there actually people who hit the park and look for Frollo?

I might actually make it a game for next time we go to Disneyland -
"Find Frollo."

More interesting is the relative scarcity of Alice (from Wonderland).
She's my favorite, and I searched the park high and low for her, only to
find her and the Mad Hatter making an exit for the break area. Frollo,
more accessible than Alice? WTF?
