This Memorial Day weekend was very relaxing and one of the nicest
weekends I've had in a while.
 
 Saturday Jenn and I ran some errands, mostly on a mission to find [the
*Guitar Hero* dual gig bag](http://www.redoctane.com/gh2-bag.html) to
store our guitars in. We didn't find it, but had a nice day out and
ended up at my parents' place, heading out to see *Shrek 3* at the end
of the day.
 
 Sunday was chore day, cleaning things up around the house. In the
evening we headed over to [Jason and
Tracy's](http://www.meyercentral.com/) place where we played four-person
*Mario Kart* until all hours.
 
 Monday was my easy day, though Jenn got a lot of great stuff done that
had been needing to get done around the house. I caught up on my comic
reading, watched some shows, and generally took it easy. Long about
1:00p I finally hit that point when I had totally decompressed and was
stress-free (yeah, it takes about three days to get there) and was
suddenly dead tired. The sun was out, the wind was gently blowing, and I
could barely keep my eyes open.
 
 That's about the time Jenn wanted to go to the store and ask for my
input on which plants would be best to put in containers. Any other day
I might have had an opinion, but my brain had just turned off and I
could not engage it.
 
 We got home, I had myself a little something caffeinated to wake me up,
and I played some [*Settlers of
Catan*](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/c/catanxboxlivearcade/default.htm)
and [*Marvel: Ultimate
Alliance*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000G82KU4/mhsvortex),
finally breaking through the 10,000 Gamerpoint barrier. I admit I stood
up and did the happy dance with that.
 
 My brain is once again engaged this morning, I'm sipping some crappy
generic French Roast coffee, and I'm ready to face the week, slightly
less stressed.
