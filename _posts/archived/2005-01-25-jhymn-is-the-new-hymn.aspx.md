It looks as though [JHymn](http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/) is the
only supported version of [hymn](http://hymn-project.org/) left, at
least, [according to the hymn
forums](http://www.hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=460).

 JHymn has a lot more flexibility than hymn did, but doesn't seem to
have a command line interface, which makes it difficult to integrate
into a script. That said, it does have functionality to back up your
protected music to a new location once it's scrubbed of DRM, so it sort
of does what my M4P Backup script did anyway.

 I'll have to get this thing running, then I'll share my settings with
the rest of you.
