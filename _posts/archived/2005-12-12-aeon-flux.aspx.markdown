Went with [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and Tif to see [*Aeon
Flux*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0402022/) this weekend.

 Now, I'm a fan of [the
cartoon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B8I9XQ/mhsvortex). I
admit I came in thinking (hoping) that they'd stay faithful to it and
reproduce the coolness (and oddness) that the cartoon renders.

 I was disappointed.

 It's not that [Charlize Theron](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/) did
a bad job - she didn't. She was pretty good as Aeon. It wasn't that the
premise was bad - it wasn't. They came up with a reasonable plot with
respect to the cartoon. It wasn't even bad effects - they worked in the
cool gadgets and some of the more odd things the cartoon had to offer
tech-wise.

 It's just that... well, it's like they said when they were making the
thing, "Hey, we can be 100% faithful to the cartoon with this movie,
except where we can't be totally faithful. Then... aw, fuck it. Half-ass
the thing and call it a day."

 The cartoon felt rich and intriguing. The movie felt sort of hollow. I
didn't feel for any of the characters. I didn't get to like them. I
didn't care why they were doing what they were doing. It very much felt
like it was just going through the motions.

 If you see it, do it on a rental. I might even wait until it's off the
new release wall at the video store and pay your buck. You'd do better,
though, to [pick up the cartoon and watch Aeon in her full
glory](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B8I9XQ/mhsvortex) and
pretend the live action version just never happened.
