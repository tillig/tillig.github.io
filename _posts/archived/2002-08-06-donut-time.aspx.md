Or not, as I'm finding out. A little background...

 Every Tuesday, my department of seven people gets together for a staff
meeting. About half of the meeting is comprised of eating donuts, while
the other half is an attempt to explain to the group what you've been
doing.

 (I don't do too well with the explaining portion of things because
nobody really understands what I do anyway.)

 When we first started these meetings, they were scheduled for 8:00a. I
thought that was pretty good, since you get in and go right to the
donuts. Besides which, that forces the people who saunter in at 9:00a or
later to be here early for once.

 People didn't like that. The meeting moved to 9:00a because the
latecomers insisted on their rights to show up late. Fine.

 Then a round of layoffs happened and my boss, previously only a
web-related guy, became the CIT manager. With the vastly reduced staff,
he also got to take up a bunch of other staff meetings and sit in on
things that only peripherally relate to CIT. Due to those exciting and
oh-so-necessary meetings, our meeting moved to 10:00a. Not as good, but
acceptable.

 Just yesterday he emailed us that, "due to schedule conflicts," the
meeting has to be rescheduled for today... **to 11:00a**.

 What the fuck is all that about? 11:00? Why don't we make it a frickin'
lunch meeting if it's going to be that late? I'm gonna eat a donut at
11, not be hungry for lunch, then have a sugar crash around 2:00p and be
sick for the rest of the day. What sort of a lame idea is that?

 Irritating. We might have to have a pre-meeting meeting just to eat the
donuts, then get back together for an abbreviated discussion where
everyone gives me blank looks as I try to explain the memory leak issues
I'm working on with the Microsoft developer support team.
