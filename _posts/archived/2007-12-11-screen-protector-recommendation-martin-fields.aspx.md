[![Martin
Fields]({{ site.url }}/images/20071211martinfields.gif)](http://www.martinfields.com/US/index.asp)I've
got screen protectors on my PSP, my new iPod Classic, and various PDAs.
I've tried several different brands, but I have to say my favorite is,
by far, [Martin Fields](http://www.martinfields.com/US/index.asp).  Easy
to apply and you can't even tell you've got anything on there.  Not only
that, but their scratch resistance is amazing and they're washable and
reusable.  Replace your iPod?  Move the screen protector to the new one.

They're not too expensive, either.  At the time of this writing, both
[the
PSP](http://www.martinfields.com/US/dis_product.asp?model=sonypsp&modeln=PSP%20(black/white/pink)&prod_type=screen)
and [the iPod
Classic](http://www.martinfields.com/US/dis_product.asp?model=iPod_Classic&modeln=Classic&prod_type=screen)
protectors are $12.99.

Interestingly, I always forget the name of the place, then I go research
whenever I get a new device and end up getting one of these.  I figured
I'd blog it so I can remember for next time.
