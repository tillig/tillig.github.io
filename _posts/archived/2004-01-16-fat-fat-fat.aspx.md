There's an [interesting article in the *Willamette
Week*](http://www.wweek.com/flatfiles/News4727.lasso) local newspaper
conjecturing on why Oregonians are so fat. I've actually wondered that
myself - why aren't I motivated to do something about these ridiculous
"love handles" or the gut that continually generates the need for newer,
larger pants?

 Of all of the ideas they bring up, I think the weather is probably the
most accurate reason we're fat... at least, that's how it is for me. Who
wants to go riding your bike in the drizzle? Who wants to do *anything*
when it's pouring down outside? With an average of only 68 non-rain days
per year, it's no wonder.

 They also mention that fatty foods are much more affordable than
healthy foods. I'll agree with that, too. I was just mentioning the
other day that it'd be nice if you could go up to McDonald's or
something and get a healthy meal for $3 instead of filling up on deep
fried fat.

 Maybe I should move somewhere sunny. I wonder if I'd be more motivated
to exercise. Then again, I also wonder if I'm just inherently lazy and
should accept that for what it is.
