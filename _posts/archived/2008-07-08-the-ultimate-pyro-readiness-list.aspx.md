I've been doing various fireworks shows for the past few years and each
year I always end up having to recreate the list of things I want to
bring along with me to the shoot. Instead of constantly updating and
forgetting and such, here's the list of everything you'd want to bring
with you if you're shooting a show.

This is pretty exhaustive and will probably need to be adjusted for
based on the shoot. For example, sometimes you have to dig trenches so
you'll need a shovel... but if you're not digging, no shovel required.
Obviously if you've got more than one person, you may need to adjust
quantities. Also, sometimes the company you're shooting for will provide
some equipment. Here we go...

-   **Tools**
    -   Shovel
    -   Rake (like, one of those wide plastic ones for raking leaves)
    -   Pocket knife
    -   Pliers (if you have a Leatherman tool,Â use that)
    -   Cordless drill with screwdriver bits
    -   Hammer
    -   Large marker (like a Sharpie)
    -   Masking tape
    -   Flashlight
    -   Continuity tester

-   **Clothing**
    -   Leather work gloves
    -   Firefighter turnout or other flame-retardant overcoat
    -   Knee pads
    -   Sunglasses
    -   Hat with brim
    -   Foam ear plugs
    -   Helmet (motorcycle or firefighter)

-   **Sustenance**
    -   Water
    -   Gatorade
    -   Energy drinks
    -   Dry food - crackers, granola bars, etc.

-   **Amenities**
    -   Cooler (for your food/drinks)
    -   Camp chair
    -   Camp table
    -   Shade shelter (one of those four-metal-legs-and-a-tarp things
        works great)
    -   Moist washcloth in plastic bag
    -   Digital camera
    -   Book/magazine

-   **Health products**
    -   Excedrin Migraine
    -   Ibuprofen
    -   Pseudoephedrine (or other decongestant)
    -   Sunscreen - SPF45 or better
    -   Moist towelettes
    -   Bug repellent
