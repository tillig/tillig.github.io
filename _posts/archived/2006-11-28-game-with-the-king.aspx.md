King has this crazy promotion going right now where you can get three
Xbox/Xbox 360 games for $3.99 each when you get a value meal. The games
are:

 **Sneak King**: You sneak around as the Burger King and surprise people
with food. It's sort of creepy and extremely novel. It gets a little
repetetive after a bit, but it's still pretty fun. This is my favorite
of the three.

 **Big Bumpin'**: You and three other players (local or over Xbox Live)
drive bumper cars around in a variety of competitions. This is a pretty
decent party game, but there are only four courses and four game types,
and you don't pick them individually - there are a certain number of
pre-set combinations of course and game type. Not super flexible, but
still fun.

 **PocketBike Racer**: You and three other players (local or over Xbox
Live) drive miniature motorcycles around courses. It's basically a
slimmed-down kart racing game. You have some weapons that don't seem to
come in too handy and the controls are a little sloppy. Of the three,
this one is my least favorite, but I can't complain much for $4.

 They have a whole [BK Gamer web site](http://www.bkgamer.com) where you
can see more about it and the leaderboards for the games. You can even
add the Burger King as a friend ([Gamertag:

If you get a chance, head out to BK. It's too novel to pass up.
