Been playing [Soul Calibur
III](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000935256/mhsvortex) for
several weeks now trying to beat Chronicle 20 in the "Chronicles of the
Sword" mode. The last guy is Strife, a level 50-something knight who
kills you in about three hits.
 
 I entered that stage as a level 45 character. By the time I beat
Strife, I was a level 89. [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and I had
fought this guy so many times, we were calling 10 runs through the level
"a unit," and we had put in several "units."
 
 The ironic thing is that it wasn't my level 89 character that beat
Strife, but a level 40 character that I had just created. Here's what
you do:
 
 Create either a Sword Master or a Sage character. Play enough battles
to unlock the Soul Calibur weapon for the Chinese Blade discipline and
equip your character with that. When you fight Strife, just mash on the
A button (horizontal attack). Don't hit anything else. If he gets a shot
in, just stand up and keep mashing A. The trick is that the Chinese
Blade Soul Calibur is fast enough to hit Strife and not let him get a
strike in. Even if he blocks, eventually he'll let down his guard and
try to hit you, but you'll be too busy smacking him with Soul Calibur.
 
 It's a sort of slow process since each strike only takes a little
sliver of his health away, but that's the way to go. (Interestingly
enough, this strategy works against most of the AI characters. You can
get a level 1 guy to beat a level 60 Astaroth just with this
technique.)
