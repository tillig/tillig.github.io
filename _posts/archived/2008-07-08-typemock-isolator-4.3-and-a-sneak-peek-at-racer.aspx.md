I'm a few days late on this (I was on vacation) but [Typemock Isolator
4.3 has been
released](http://blog.typemock.com/2008/07/isolator-43-released.html)
and has some great new features like
[Ivonna](http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx) integration for ASP.NET testing.
Check out [the blog post on
it](http://blog.typemock.com/2008/07/isolator-43-released.html) and then
[go get it](http://www.typemock.com/Downloads.php)!

While I'm on the subject of Typemock, Roy Osherove has offered up [a
sneak preview of the new Typemock Racer
tool](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2008/07/08/a-sneak-preview-of-typemock-racer.aspx)
he's working on that will help detect thread deadlock. Very promising,
indeed. [Check out his site for some great
screenshots](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2008/07/08/a-sneak-preview-of-typemock-racer.aspx).
