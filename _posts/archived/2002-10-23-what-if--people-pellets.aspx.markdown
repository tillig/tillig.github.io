Okay, so everyone knows about owl pellets, right? Owls can't digest all
the stuff from their prey (bones, hair, etc.) and since they eat their
prey whole, that stuff has to go somewhere - enter owl pellets.
 
 So I thought about this - what if there were *people pellets*? Take
that a step further, what if people excreted/coughed-up/disgorged
pellets rather than pooping? Think about how much easier that is. You'd
still probably have to use the restroom for liquid waste, but for solid
waste, you could just chuck your pellet into the trash can.
 
 I suppose there'd be two possibilities for the pellet - either it gets
coughed up (like owls) or it comes out *the other end*. If you cough it
up, just spit it out... but if you poop it out, you'd have to "go
digging" to get it, then throw it out. Either way, assuming the pellets
are clean (like owl pellets), loads of sanitary issues would be solved.
Gotta take a dump? Do it. Then just throw your pellet out.
 
 There'd be pellet disposal containers in bathrooms. Under desks. In
your living room. Built into your favorite easy chair.
 
 I told Jenn about this, and she was like, "Wouldn't people be disgusted
by other peoples' pellets?" I don't think so. You have to consider, if
there were such thing as people pellets, that's how it *always* would
have been. People wouldn't know any better - that'd be just how it is.
 
 I think that'd be kind of cool. No more messy wiping. No more stinky
bathroom. Pellet. Done.
