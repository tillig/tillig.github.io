I entered [Roy Osherove's Add-In
Contest](http://dev.magen.com/AddinContest/default.aspx) with my add-in,
[Solvent](/archive/2004/06/25/solvent---power-toys-for-visual-studio-.net.aspx).
 
 I just found out this morning that [I won second place with
it](http://dev.magen.com/AddinContest/pages/Winners.aspx)! Very cool,
considering this is my first outing with add-in development. [Pretty
cool prize](http://dev.magen.com/AddinContest/pages/Prizes.aspx), too,
if I do say so myself.
 
 Nothing like winning a contest to brighten your day, you know? I should
just go home now before work spoils my mood. Heh.
