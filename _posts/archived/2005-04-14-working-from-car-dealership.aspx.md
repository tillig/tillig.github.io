Okay, I realize I'm going to sound like I'm *so* living in 1996 or
something, but I have my car getting worked on this morning at the
dealership and they have *free wireless networking*. This is crazy shit.
I can get stuff done while I wait. Can't beat that.

 Speaking of Internet access, our Comcast cable 'net access seems to be
giving me fits in the last couple of days. The DNS lookups... don't look
up. Like, it just times out. Sometimes you can get common sites -
google, Yahoo! - to come up, but that's about it. I tried resetting my
router and my cable modem (just in case it was a hardware problem; I
hadn't rebooted either for like a year) but to no avail - DNS still
lags. Jenn's calling Comcast today.
