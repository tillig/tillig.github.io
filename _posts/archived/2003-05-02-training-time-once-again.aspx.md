Due to my utter insistence on knowing what I'm doing at work, I
[connived myself some
training](/archive/2003/04/11/bring-out-the-gimp.aspx). I start Monday
with a class Monday about ["Building COM+ Applications Using Microsoft
.NET Enterprise
Services"](http://www.sqlsoft.com/courses/coursedesc/MS-2557.html) or
something. I'm not sure I'm really all that qualified for it, but here's
hoping. Either way, I'm looking forward to training - it's always [like
a vacation](/archive/2003/03/17/training-like-a-vacation.aspx).

 No real plans for the weekend except for a barbecue we're having for my
dad's birthday. His birthday was actually a couple of weeks ago, but he
was out of town. Better late than never, I guess. I'll probably go over
early so I can wash my car. It's really dirty, and I need to
[Rain-X](http://www.rainx.com/) my windows again.

 Other than that, there's nothing exciting going on. Work's stressing me
out enough that I can actually feel my own blood pressure and I don't
see any end in sight for that. Money's tight because Jenn's in the
throes of her pharmacy technician externship (six weeks of unpaid work).
I drank a lot of coffee earlier and had a pretty harsh crap. That's
about it.

 Speaking of coffee, I really don't like it, but with this
getting-up-too-early crap that Jenn's got me doing, I don't see much
alternative. The deal is, she has to be at work by 7:00a. If she takes
the bus, it takes two hours to get there, so she'd be getting up at
4:00a to get ready... at which point I'd be up. She can't park at work
because they won't give her a permit (if you're not a full-time,
permanent employee who carpools, you don't get a permit), so she can't
drive herself. What does that mean?

 It means I'm up at fucking 5:45a every morning so we can both be ready
and out the door by 6:30a, getting her to work on time. Then I just
continue on to work, and I get there by like 7:10a.

 I'm not a morning person. I fucking *hate* the morning. I really start
functioning around 11:00a or so - getting up early is not my thing. If
the world worked swing shift, that'd be easier for me. Instead, I'm up
too early and have started a coffee habit. Of course, it's more of a
luxury than a requirement or addiction; if I don't have it, I don't get
headaches or withdrawals, I'm just more tired. Tired like someone who
gets up too early. Blarg.
