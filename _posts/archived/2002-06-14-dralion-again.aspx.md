![Cirque du Soleil
eTicket]({{ site.url }}/images/20020614cirqueseatsty4.gif)Guess
where I'll be tonight! That's right, Jenn and I have tickets for the
9:00p showing of [Cirque du Soleil's](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/)
traveling show,
*[Dralion](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/touring/dralion)*.
I saw them last time they were in town with their
*[Saltimbanco](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/touring/saltimbanco)*
show and also twice in Vegas I saw their
*[Mystere](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/resident/mystere)*
show. All of them were *brilliance*, and I look forward to tonight's
performance. Jenn's never seen them, so she's excited, too. We have
[pretty good
seats]({{ site.url }}/images/20020614eticketug1.gif),
too, which makes it all that much better.

 My copy of *[Real
Genius](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065U1Q/mhsvortex)*
didn't come yesterday, so I have to assume today's the day. I was all
excited to see it, and now I've gotta wait until this weekend.

 Speaking of this weekend, my friend Aarron's coming into town and I
think I'm going to try to convince him that we need to go see *[The
Bourne Identity](http://www.thebourneidentity.com/)*. It looks too cool,
and it's got Franka Potente in it, which makes it all that much better.
She was great in *[Run Lola
Run](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000021Y77/mhsvortex)*, so I
expect she'll be great here, too. (Oh, and *Run Lola Run* had a [pretty
bitchin'
soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JG17/mhsvortex),
to boot.) So we might check that out. Jenn wants to see it, too.

 Aside from that, I'm hoping to take it easy. After [painting our living
room](/archive/2002/06/03/double-wide-shine-on-the-boothills-of-your-prime.aspx),
our place is in a shambles, so I'm sure there will be cleaning up to do,
but the weather's supposed to be nice, so maybe I'll try to take
advantage of it. Somehow. Not sure on how yet, but I'll figure it out
when I get there.
