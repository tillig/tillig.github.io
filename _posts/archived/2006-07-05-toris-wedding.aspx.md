I've taken a loooong weekend, from June 30 - July 5, for a couple of
reasons. The first is my sister's wedding. The second is fireworks...
but that'll be a different entry.

 ![Tori and
Brandon]({{ site.url }}/images/20060701wedding.jpg)My
sister Tori was married to a fellow named Brandon on Saturday, July 1.
The ceremony was held in the Mormon temple in Bellevue, WA, so I didn't
actually get to see it. Instead, Jenn and I made the
three-and-a-half-hour-each-way trip up and back on Saturday to be at the
reception, also held in Bellevue, on Saturday afternoon.

 Friday (the 30th) was Jenn and I getting things done so we were ready
for the trip Saturday.

 Saturday around 11:00a we left so we could be there at 3:00p for
pictures (and maybe stop on the way for something to eat). We got there
in time to have some lunch at Burgermaster (Jenn's first time!) and did,
in fact, make it for the pictures.

 At the reception we got to meet a lot of Brandon's family and we saw a
few folks from ours that we don't normally get to see, which was good.
It was hot, so we mostly tried to stay in the shade, but there was a
nice garden setup with some tables and such in shady areas, so Jenn and
I relaxed and enjoyed the festivities.

 At about 6:30p, the reception was over, Tori and Brandon left, and Jenn
and I were once again on the road for a long drive home. We got home a
little after 10:00p.

 Congratulations, Brandon and Tori!
