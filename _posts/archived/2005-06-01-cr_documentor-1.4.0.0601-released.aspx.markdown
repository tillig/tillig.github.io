The new version has been released and provides the following updates:
 
Added logging to the DXCore "Messages" window.

Fixed bug where nested lists weren't rendering correctly.

Optimized context menu creation.

Optimized handling of XmlDocuments for faster rendering in preview
window.

Updated parser error handling to more accurately display information
about the location of errors in XML comments. (Errors now show
approximate line/character locations in relation to the source document
as well as in relation to the XML comment begin/end.)

Fixed bug where attributes on unrecognized tags weren't passing through
to be rendered.
