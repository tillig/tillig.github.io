This evening is the end of my nine day sabbatical, and I look back on it
with fondness, like the end of a movie where the person flashes back to
all the good times in their life in a soft focus. I did nothing, and it
was everything I thought it could be.
 
 Tomorrow I'll return to work and wade through the emails, voice mails,
sticky notes, white board scribblings, and other communicative relics
folks felt so inclined to leave for me in my absence. I'll do my best to
make sense of what happened while I was gone, piecing fragments of
communiques together in a near-arbitrary order (since chronological
doesn't ever quite do it), and people will ask why I'm not done with
whatever it was I was working on, what my status is.
 
 Sigh.
 
 I will also face the choice of allowing myself to be distracted by the
innumerable requests for a recount of my adventures in San Andreas or
blocking my cubicle door, at which point I will only get half as many
requests, these from the people who think the "I'm Busy" indicators
outside my cube really don't apply to them (and those people would be
incorrect). I will attempt to point them to my web site, where there is
bound to be more richness and detail about my travels than I am able to
impart in the abbreviated time allotted, but they will all always rather
hear it directly from me, since I obviously will have copious amounts of
time to spare on such things my first couple of days back.
 
 In the end, my vacation was good, and I am glad I took it. However,
when I return to work, bright and early tomorrow morning, I will
probably close my eyes, shake my head, and wonder if it was really worth
it, to take a small amount of relaxation time in the midst of one of my
neverending projects, just so I can be that much further behind.
 
 That said, I suppose it can be argued that if one is constantly
sprinting, when "crunch time" really comes and additional speed is
required, there will be no energy left to go that extra mile.
 
 I think the answer is that maybe, just maybe, life itself needs to slow
down - just a little - so it isn't always required that one sprints;
perhaps slow and steady really does win the race. Sadly, the business
world - the high-tech business world - rests for no one, and doesn't
really afford its minions the rest, either. One must take one one can
get, and enjoy it while it lasts, since the world waits for no one.
 
 Onward, ever forward, I go.
