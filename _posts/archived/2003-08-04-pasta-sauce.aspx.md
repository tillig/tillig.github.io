Okay, here's another of my million dollar ideas that I had yesterday in
the car:

 You know how you can go to sex shops and joke gift shops and get that
[penis-shaped pasta](http://bacheloretteparties.com/penpasininsi.html)?
Well, what do you put *on* that pasta when you want to eat it?

 The Answer: ***Bearded Clam Sauce***

 You read it here first, folks. Just get a bunch of cans of prepackaged
white clam sauce, slap a new label on (or, better, partner with the
manufacturer), and *voila!* you're a millionaire.

 Jenn told me that if we had the money to throw away, I could hire a
full-time personal assistant to follow me around in a French maid
outfit. *This*, my friends, is *the key*.
