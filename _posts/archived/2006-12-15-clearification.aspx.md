[![Clearification]({{ site.url }}/images/20061215clearification.jpg)](http://www.clearification.com/)I'm
really not sure [what this is](http://www.clearification.com/) - if it's
some sort of "viral marketing campaign" that I'm not smart enough to
get, or just some experimental thing - but it's tied to Microsoft
Windows Vista somehow and it's intriguing. There are these episodes
telling the story of this guy, Demetri, and his odd psychological
issues. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but I will. How can I
not?
