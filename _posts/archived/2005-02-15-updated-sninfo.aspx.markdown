I updated the
[SNInfo](/archive/2005/02/07/sninfo---strong-naming-info-for-.net-assemblies.aspx)
app I wrote for displaying assembly strong name information so now it
shows a minimum amount of information in a small window to start with,
and you can click a button to expand the form and see more detailed
info. I also added the full public key to the information displayed, and
updated the app so you can drop an assembly right on the SNInfo.exe
program and it'll open up with the information directly (rather than
having to open SNInfo and then drag the assembly onto it). Oh, and you
can click on a "copy" button next to each field to copy that respective
information to the clipboard.

 Full source and compiled executable available. [Have at
it.](/archive/2005/02/07/sninfo---strong-naming-info-for-.net-assemblies.aspx)
