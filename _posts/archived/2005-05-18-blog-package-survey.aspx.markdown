I'm looking at different blog packages and trying to determine what
people like and don't like about their current blog software. If you
have a blog (or if you would like to have a blog), please take a sec and
fill in my six-question survey to tell me what you think is good or bad
about their blog packages. What do you like? What don't you like?
 *Old survey has been removed.*
