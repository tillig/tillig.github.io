I got my copy of the CC&R document for the neighborhood I'll be moving
into. I have mixed feelings on the whole thing. On the one hand, as a
homeowner I'd like to be able to do whatever I want to my own house. On
the other, there's no accounting for taste, so I'm glad there's at least
*some* sort of checks and balances going on.
 
 I wish there was an English version of the thing, though. It's all
written in Legal, which is difficult to understand at best. I get the
basic gist of it, but the particulars are a little more difficult. Do
you have to ask before you plant stuff? It sure looks like it. I suppose
it depends on whether it's in good taste or not. And who defines good
taste? The "committee" (which is like something out of a James Bond
movie... sort of ominous sounding... some nebulous entity that may or
may not truly exist, and if it does exist, it may not be for the forces
of good...).
 
 I can live with it. I wasn't about to put up a pole barn in my front
yard anyway.
