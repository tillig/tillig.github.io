[Looks like my company is getting
acquired.](http://www.corillian.com/corporate/news/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=337)
People have always bandied about the notion of "what if" and so on, but
I don't really think I believed it would happen. Yet here we are -
[CheckFree](http://www.checkfreecorp.com) bought us out (which is
ironic, because Corillian was originally a spin-off of CheckFree.... are
we coming home to roost?).
 
 There's a conference call later that will hopefully answer questions,
but I find that most of these types of calls raise more questions than
they answer, or at least muddy the waters so you don't really know what
the answer is. You could ask if grass is green and you'd get a ten
minute response about varying types of grass, season, water levels,
atmospheric pressure, and the possibility of disease in the grass, all
of which could affect the level and hue of color in the aforementioned
grass but no one would really commit to saying the grass is green.
 
 I've only got three questions:

1.  Do I still have a job?
2.  If I do, will I need to relocate to keep it?
3.  What's the story with existing Corillian options and ESPP shares?


 I guess we'll see. I suppose short-term I can't complain - the stock's
jumped like \$1.50 just today.
