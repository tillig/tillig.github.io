Typemock is hosting [a free online seminar on August
11](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/08/unit-testing-legacy-code-in-net-live.html)
to show you how to unit test legacy/existing code. It's free, and these
are usually pretty good, so if you have to work with existing code you
can't modify but want to test, [head over there and
register](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/08/unit-testing-legacy-code-in-net-live.html).
