I've been going over my RSS feeds this morning and I found a bunch of
cool things that I've been forwarding to my team. Helpful tools,
articles that explain tough concepts... good stuff. As I was doing that,
I kept thinking, "Oooo, I should bookmark this so I can find it again
later."

That's when it hit me, and I'm sure I'm not the first to arrive at this
one:

**Bookmarks are worthless.**

I was thinking about it and with some very small exceptions I can't
actually remember the last time I visited a site based on bookmarks.
Generally speaking, Google is my bookmark anymore (and not in a "Google
Bookmarks" way). If I need to find something, I just search for it.
Chances are the resource I would have bookmarked before has been
superceded by some better, newer resource anyway. If it's really good, I
might blog it so I can tell people about it, but even by doing that, I'm
contributing to the PageRank of the resource so if I go search for it
again, it's still on Google. Or, barring that, I can search my own site
for the link I posted and get it there.

The only real exceptions to this are internal sites - stuff like the
expense report system or the PTO request form that I might use a lot but
aren't in Google and aren't right on the intranet home page. Other than
that, I think I'm going to clean out my bookmarks - I don't need 'em.
