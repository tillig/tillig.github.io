I just got a call from the TV repair facility and they've *finally* been
authorized to replace the tube in my television. Of course, they aren't
coming to pick it up until the 29th of this month... but at least
they're finally going to be fixing it.
 
 I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's dim, but it's there
now.
