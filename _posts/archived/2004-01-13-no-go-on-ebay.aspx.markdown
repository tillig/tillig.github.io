My eBay item (well, *items*, since it was a set of 10 shirts) didn't
sell. In fact, it didn't get to half of my reserve price, which could
mean one of a few things:
 
 First, it may mean that some folks don't want 10 shirts. Or not the
people who have money.
 
 Second, it may mean that I've over-valued the items. I don't think so,
though; new t-shirts go for about \$12, I figured I could get \$7 for
barely-used ones.
 
 Third, it may mean that people don't like reserve auctions. Bah. I was
reluctant to start the bidding really high on the item because I didn't
want to discourage bidders right off, but then, some people just don't
even bid on reserve auctions. Can't win for losing. At least I can see
what's what, now.
 
 I suppose this means I need to re-list these things, but this time I'll
do it individually. I guess we'll see what happens.
