In a downward trend from the last
[two](/archive/2005/11/01/155-trick-or-treaters.aspx)
[years](/archive/2006/11/01/162-trick-or-treaters.aspx), we came in at
139 trick-or-treaters this year.  Many more older kids came by, many in
that "hey, maybe you should have actually worn a costume" state.

The graph:

The 6:30 - 7:30 hour was the most productive, and once again 6:30 to
7:00 seems to be prime candy-grabbing time.  Two Costco bags of candy
were sufficient with about a quarter-bag left over, though instead of
mini candy bars like we had last year, this year we handed out more of a
"candy assortment" (many more small candies rather than fewer large
candies).  We ran a half-hour longer than we did last year due to the
poor turnout of the first half-hour starting at 6:00.

Still, it was a pretty decent sized reduction in kids this year, and I
think it may have been one or more of several factors at play:

-   Average age of the neighborhood kids increases as time goes by -
    less locals seeking candy.
-   This is the first year daylight saving time was changed for that
    energy bill - it's darker a little earlier until we switch over and
    that may have stopped the earlier/smaller kids from venturing out.
-   Last year we had a projector showing an animated Halloween scene on
    our garage.  I got home too late to put it out this year.  Less
    decoration - less enticing to knock on the door.

I think next year I'll make it a point to put the projector out and see
if that changes things.  The average age of kids can't be helped, but
the DST issue won't have changed.
