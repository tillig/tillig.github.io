In [*Casino
Royale*](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/casinoroyale/site/) (both
the book and the movie), Bond orders a fairly unique martini while
gambling and names it after the girl he's with. Just as much a reminder
for me and information for you, here's the recipe:
 
 3 measures gin
 1 measure vodka
 1/2 measure dry vermouth
 
 Shake ingredients together, strain into a martini glass, and garnish
with lemon peel.
 
 They specify [Gordon's gin](http://www.gordons-gin.co.uk/), but I'm a
[Bombay Sapphire](http://www.bombaysapphire.com/) drinker so I'll
probably stick to that. They also specify [Kina
Lillet](http://www.tjbd.co.uk/drinks/kina-lillet.htm), but that's been
thought to be a little too bitter so Lillet vermouth should be used
instead... but I'm not a vermouth connoisseur so I couldn't say on
that.
 
 There is a fantastic [outline of James Bond drinks over at The James
Bond Dossier](http://www.tjbd.co.uk/james-bond-drink.htm) and a great
discussion specifically about [the difference between shaking and
stirring a martini at The Straight
Dope](http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mmartini.html). Interesting
stuff.
