I added some new crap to the [*paraesthesia junk
store*](http://www.cafeshops.com/paraesthesia,like_to_help_01,hate_people_01,paraesthesia_02)
including some t-shirts, a camisole, panties (extra points awarded for
sending pictures of you *wearing* the panties), and a rather cool wall
clock that I myself may have to pick up.
 
 [Give it a
look](http://www.cafeshops.com/paraesthesia,like_to_help_01,hate_people_01,paraesthesia_02),
then buy lots of stuff, eh?
