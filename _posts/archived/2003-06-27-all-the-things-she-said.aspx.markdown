Something I forgot to mention in the last few entries was that I bought
a couple of CDs to listen to on the trip to Bellevue and back. In
searching for them, I looked for some decent upbeat dance-style music so
I could stay awake and do a little toe-tapping.

 What I found was [t.A.T.u.](http://www.tatugirls.com)

 Now, I'll admit, I'm never first on the bandwagon for things, though
many times I'd like to be, so I'm sure some of you have already
discovered this musical gem. For those not in the know, I'll enlighten
you. See, t.A.T.u. is either a miracle gift from God Himself or a total
stroke of *Pure Marketing Genius*.

 Imagine if you will... two hot... teenage... Russian... lesbians... who
wear Catholic school girl outfits... and sing *really killer dance
songs*.

 That's right, you heard me correctly. Hot teenage Russian lesbians in
school girl outfits singing dance songs. That's like something straight
out of [hentai](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hentai).
But it's true, and I'm totally sucked in, probably exactly as the
t.A.T.u. marketing team figured I would be.

 The thing is, I'd be enraged at the whole manipulation of my inner male
if I wasn't so stoked about *the music*. I actually like *every song on
the album*. It's even better in the native Russian language - there are
only two Russian versions on the album I have, but now I'm trying to
find the full original Russian version of the album.

 Anyway, if you're into the dance thing, check out their album [*200
km/h in the Wrong
Lane*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006JJ1O/mhsvortex). I'm
groovin' to it *right now*.

 I've thus far only found one down side - they're young, so they're not
performers. I was over at [MTV.com](http://www.mtv.com) searching for
[performances](http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/t_a_t_u_/audvid.jhtml)
because I'd heard they were okay, but to me the show I saw was pretty
robotic looking. I'm sure they'll improve with time, which is just fine
with me.
