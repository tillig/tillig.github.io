I have this feeling that I'm not going to get anything done today. I
have meetings booked solid on my calendar from 9:00a until noon, then
they start again at 1:00p. I might be able to work for a couple of hours
this afternoon. Maybe.

 Plus, today should be the last day of this way-too-long project I've
been working on. I'm anxious to get off of it because the next project
I'm going to be on looks like I'll get some really good stuff done.
(Rather than working on a hacked-together prototype, I actually get to
put effort in to make production code - a much more satisfying
endeavor.)
