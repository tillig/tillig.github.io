We went yesterday to Chang's Mongolian Grill (all you can eat, baby!)
for lunch, and while I love Chang's, Chang's doesn't seem to love me.
I've had terrible gas since then (woke Jenn up at around four this
morning with my farting in my sleep), our whole apartment smells like
garlic, and I just dropped a loaf that would kill a small army. Damn.

 I'm still working on my [pMachine](http://www.pmachine.com) upgrade.
I've got some good ideas on paper, now I just have to compose my
thoughts on the computer. I tried a couple of things yesterday that
turned out like crap, so I've started that over. We'll see how it goes.

 I've been working with the [Microsoft Log
Parser](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=56FC92EE-A71A-4C73-B628-ADE629C89499&displaylang=en),
a tool that allows you to query - like a database - activity logs from
your web site. It's pretty slick and really fast. Plus, it comes with a
programmatic component you can use to write your own programs that take
advantage of the fast and easy parsing capabilities that Microsoft has
already built.

 We have a guy at our company who wrote his own log parser that analyzes
logs for security attacks. I suggested that he look into using the
programmatic component in his analyzer because, well, why reinvent the
wheel? Especially in the case of program code that you don't want to
have to maintain. Why not use the robust engine provided you *for
free*?

 I got the response that the *log parser isn't smart enough*. Huh? Sure,
maybe the canned executable version isn't, but the componentized version
is only as smart as you make it. Sounds like the thing not smart enough
is the guy writing the program. Oh, well. Can't save everyone from
themselves.

 I guess they're trying to patent this thing, too, which I hope does not
imply that they're going to try to sell it, because I've seen the
reports it spits out and legible they are not. Maybe they should hire a
UI guy to look at that stuff... but, of course, with the code they've
got built up, who knows how maintainable (or adjustable) it is? Some
people program when they really just *shouldn't*.

 I got my new Fisher Space Pen yesterday in the mail.

 ![Fisher Space Pen... straight from Mulholland Drive! (5k

 I'm actually pretty stoked about it. It looks really cool, and I think
the grip on the end of the pen is pretty nifty. Anyway, there it is - if
you find it somewhere, it will be because I lost it, so please give it
back if you do. So far, I've had it sitting right here just fine all
morning.

 I think tonight I'm going to go see
[*Underworld*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320691/). Can't really pass
on the whole *Matrix*-like thing, plus, you really can't beat [Kate
Beckinsale](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000295/) in tight garb.

 And one final treat - a [great picture of Jennifer Garner arriving at
last year's Emmy Awards
ceremony](http://www.imdb.com/Special/Emmy/2003/Photos/2002arrivals-34.html).
Yow!
