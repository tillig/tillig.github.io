Saturday marked the fifth annual *24* marathon at my house, this year
for [season
six](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MR8W92?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000MR8W92). 
We started at 8:00a and ran non-stop, no credits, no "last-time-on," no
breaks.  The show ended at 1:00a Sunday morning, and it was a hell of a
ride.

My dad and I were the only ones who lasted the whole thing.  Jenn missed
the last few episodes, being unable to stay awake, and our friend K came
for the morning but wasn't able to stay for the whole marathon.

I've found that the secret to the last couple of episodes is to drink an
energy drink or two and to stand up.  After sitting for most of the day,
standing up really energizes you.

Once again, Jack Bauer saved the day, lasting through torture in a
Chinese prison, a nuclear attack, and an air strike.  I still think my
favorite season was [season
two](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008YGRU?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00008YGRU),
but I can't say I was disappointed here.  A good time was had by all,
and we'll plan to see season seven (assuming [Kiefer can get his ass out
of jail and film the damn
thing](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ic81707e04a7d9217d3228c4ff3af8ad9))
next year.
