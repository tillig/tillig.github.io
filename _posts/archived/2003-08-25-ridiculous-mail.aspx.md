I haven't been able to get my personal email at work all day today
because they shut down POP access at the firewall (thanks,
[W32/Sobig.f@MM](http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_100561.htm)) and the
webmail interface to my mail is not working. So I'm sure I've got like
30,000 emails waiting for me, but I'll just have to put off answering
them until shit settles down. If you emailed me, I'm not ignoring you, I
just can't get to your message.
