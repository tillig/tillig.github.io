More irritation for my Jenn:
 
 I found that on [GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com) they have quite a
robust selection of [Grand Theft Auto 3 game
guides](http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/game/31127.html). The cool
thing is, there's a great set of maps showing you where all the hidden
packages are. (If you haven't played the game, that may not make sense -
there are all these little packages hidden around the city and if you
pick up enough of them you get more weapons and stuff.)
 
 I have a decent map to them in a recent issue of [PlayStation
Magazine](http://www.gamers.com/opm/) (yes, I'm a subscriber - you
should be, too), but while the general locations are shown, a
description isn't present. Trust me - you need a description. If you're
wandering around and can't find the package, it's probably because you
have to jump your car off some ramp and land on the roof of a building,
then get out and run across a couple of other rooftops and drop down
into some totally inaccessible place in order to get it.
 
 Anyway, I've got like 27 of the 33 packages on the first island but
before I move on to the second island, I wanna get all the packages.
This will make it *so* much easier.
 
 Oh, and I'll be at the [Portland
Trailblazers](http://www.nba.com/blazers/) game tonight against the
[Memphis Grizzlies](http://www.nba.com/grizzlies/). Whoever *they* are.
Got box seats courtesy of [the ol' employer](http://www.corillian.com).
Can't complain about that, right? Hey, maybe I'll get a free
[Chalupa](http://www.tacobell.com/) out of the deal.
