I've been working a lot with Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)Â lately,
getting it to integrate with ASP.NET, and I found that while
understanding the concept of a workflow was pretty easy, getting over
the technical hump of what workflow means with respect to WF and how to
use it was pretty difficult.

What I really found while searching for resources was that there's a lot
out there about "how to use XYZ in situation ABC" but there's nothing
that explains to me what XYZ is or what its significance is in relation
to the stack.

To that end, I decided to start writing some short posts that just
explain what each of the major pieces of WF are and what their
significance is. Maybe helpful, maybe not. I'm calling it "Two Minute
WF" because I want to give a pretty high-level, easy to understand
explanation that you can read through in a couple of minutes, get it,
and move on. No major code samples, no in-depth discussions of the
bare-metal tech, just a quick hit on what these things are. Maybe if I
get through the major components I'll continue the series by adding more
examples. Maybe it'll get to that "in-depth" level at some point, but
I'd wager you can already find that content out on the web if you
search.
