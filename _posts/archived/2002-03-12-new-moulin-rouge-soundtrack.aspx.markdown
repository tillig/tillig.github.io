I'm pretty busy today, so I'm going to have to be brief...
 
 I just noticed there's a [new volume of the Moulin Rouge
soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YW4Z/mhsvortex)
out. I guess I'll be spending some hard-earned cash on that one soon;
it's got "The Pitch (Spectacular! Spectacular!)" on it - how can I pass
that up? The first volume has ingrained itself into my brain, I suppose
this one can take its rightful place alongside it.
 
 The review on the [Amazon.com
page](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YW4Z/mhsvortex) for
this new volume says that "there are but two kinds of people in the
world: Those captivated by Baz Luhrmann's heady, postmodernist musical
romp Moulin Rouge--and everybody else." I think I'm going to have to
agree with that. It's not for everyone. Though I think many of the folks
who *didn't* like it might be missing the point anyway.
