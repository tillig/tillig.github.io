I really have to stop watching shows by Tim Minear.
 
 The problem is, he always seems to be involved with shows I love. He
worked on [*Lois and
Clark*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00080ZG2O/mhsvortex),
[*Angel*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLEW/mhsvortex),
[*Wonderfalls*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GAO18/mhsvortex)...
 
 The characters are great - you care what happens to them, they're
interesting. The plots are interesting and not only reward the passing
viewer but also the long-time devotee.
 
 Networks, particularly Fox, seem to hate that sort of thing. Actual
characters that the audience cares about? Pish tosh! We don't need that
when we can make yet another reality series!
 
 I've recently become addicted to [*The
Inside*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412148/), a show about FBI crime
profilers. It's cool, and the only other crime drama I watch besides
*CSI*. I'd wager I like it just as much as *CSI*, and in some instances
I might even say I like it *more*.
 
 Of course, [Fox isn't renewing *The Inside*, it seems, and may not even
be airing all of the
episodes](http://www.timminear.net/archives/the_inside/000089.html).
Once again, a show I really get into, down the tube. Fox really needs to
figure itself out.
 
 It's probably a good thing I wasn't into
[*Firefly*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS0F/mhsvortex)
when it was on. I'd be more pissed still. Thankfully, I can still [pick
it up on
DVD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS0F/mhsvortex) and
check out what I missed and be retroactively irritated that it, too, was
cancelled.
