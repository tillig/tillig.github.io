I sent a letter to the TV repair company and [National Electronics
Warranty (NEW)](http://www.newcorp.com) because it has been so long
since I heard about who's fixing my TV or what's happening there. I sent
that letter on Thursday of last week, March 4. The TV repair company
responded and said they'd continue pinging NEW for approval on the
repair, but NEW wasn't responsive.

 It's almost a week later and I still haven't heard from NEW, so I
called them. According to them, there was some sort of communication
breakdown between them and the TV repair company where NEW was waiting
for additional information from the TV repair folks, but the TV repair
people were waiting for authorization from NEW. No one was talking to
anyone.

 While I was on hold, the guy at NEW called the TV repair people and got
things straightened out. Now they want an *additional three to five
business days* to go through approval. Because it hasn't already been
through that?

 Anyway, now they're going to figure out whether to replace the tube or
just get me a new TV altogether.

 This crap irritates me. Someone should be on top of this stuff.
Unbelieveable. I guess we'll see what happens next week when their time
is up.
