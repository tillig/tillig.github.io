I've got some cool ideas for things I want to do on my website, but it
looks like in order for me to do them with the skillz I have (reads: not
PHP), I need to change my blog software.
 
 This would be the third time I've done so, moving from
[Greymatter](http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/) to
[pMachine](http://www.pmachine.com/), and this time to
[dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net/).
 
 My only blocking factor is that there's no pMachine to dasBlog
conversion utility, so I'm going to have to write one. Just what I
needed - something else to take up my spare time.
