Went to [Target](http://www.target.com) at lunch yesterday and saw they
had, not one, but three of the Xbox 360 premium boxes in stock. Decided
to wait until [the next Tomb
Raider](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0XSN6/mhsvortex)
came out before I picked it up.

 Promptly returned after work and purchased it. Also got [a second
controller](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6MLUA/mhsvortex)
and [*Project Gotham Racing
3*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6ML28/mhsvortex).

 Hooked that bad boy up to [the ol' LCD
TV](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007UVYLW/mhsvortex) when I
got home and fired it up.

 It's awesome.

 Jenn and I raced for quite some time and determined that it's hella
fun, but neither of us are really any good at that game. It doesn't make
it less fun, we're just used to games like
[*Burnout*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002IQC8E/mhsvortex)
where the driving is vastly more arcade-oriented. It'll just take a bit
of practice, is all. The cool thing is that the two player [on the same
screen] is so clear - it's not like the other times we're playing where
you struggle to see where you're going. The benefits of higher
resolution, eh?

 I didn't join [Xbox Live](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/) yet because
I need to get [the wireless network
adapter](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6MLV4/mhsvortex)
(no network drop in that room), but once that happens, I'll be in
business.

 I'm also looking forward to checking out some of the media
capabilities. I've heard a lot about it; time to try it out firsthand.

 Now I need to convince [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and my dad
to get one and we can all play together.
