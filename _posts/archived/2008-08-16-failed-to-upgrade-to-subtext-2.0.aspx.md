Well, I gave it the old college try, but I ended up pretty well trashing
my site in the course of my attempt to upgrade to Subtext 2.0, so I had
to get restored from backup. Yow!

There seemed to be something odd to begin with when the upgrade process
wouldn't run - it sort of locked me out of the site. I got around that
only to see it say I needed to "install," not "upgrade." Ummm... well,
OK. So I did that. The database got upgraded, but then I hit the final
wall: I'm in a medium trust environment and the build won't run in
medium trust.

[Looks like I'm not the only one having a
problem.](http://www.kowitz.net/archive/2008/08/15/upgrading-to-subtext-2.0-fail.aspx)

I guess I'll have to see if I can help rectify some of this.
