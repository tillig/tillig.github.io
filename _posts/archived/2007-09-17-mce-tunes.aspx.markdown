Continuing my quest for a decent media center approach, I noticed that
[Brad
Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2007/08/19/23148.aspx)
is using [MCE Tunes](http://www.mcetunes.com) to stream iTunes content
using Windows Media Center.  (Also looks like he built his media center
for the same reason I'm building mine - as a movie jukebox.)  Looks like
MCE Tunes also works over media center extenders (Xbox 360), so that'd
be a good solution to the music portion of the media center.

I'll have to add this to my list of things to check out as I continue my
quest.  Unfortunately it only really works in the XP edition of media
center right now, so it'd mean I can't use Vista as my media center. 
Not a showstopper, but definitely something to consider.
