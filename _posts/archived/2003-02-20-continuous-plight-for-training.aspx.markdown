After some recent database-related debacles at work, I once again
entered a plea for actual, formal *training* in [SQL Server
2000](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/) administration. I mean, I'm
expected to be a DBA half the time, and I really haven't got the first
clue what I'm doing. Many times, I just happen to guess things
correctly.
 
 Apparently my long-term begging has not been in vain - or maybe my
manager is tired of me bitching - because I've been approved for the
[*Administering a Microsoft SQL Server 2000
Database*](http://www.sqlsoft.com/courses/coursedesc/MS-2072.html)
course at [SQLSoft](http://www.sqlsoft.com/). Yay, me!
