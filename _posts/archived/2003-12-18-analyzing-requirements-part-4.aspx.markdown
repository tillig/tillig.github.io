We've been going hard and heavy today, so I probably won't be posting
again until I get home here... which means this is today's report, even
though it's only midday.
 
 It took me 45 minutes to go five miles on this morning's commute, which
is not something I was planning on so I was a little late for class. I
think/hope I got some pictures of the traffic asshole that had the
accident on the bridge I needed to cross, so if I did, I'll post 'em.
 
 I got to teach some of the class yesterday (and a little today) on my
meager knowledge of Microsoft .NET code access security. I'm by no means
an expert, but I've spent many hours (and company dollars, I'm sure) on
the phone with MS developer support fighting code access security
issues, so I do have some decent knowledge of it (and what a huge pain
in the ass it is).
 
 I'm not looking forward to taking the test for this class. Gonna suck,
big time.
 
 Speaking of tests, Jenn got her results from when she took the national
[pharmacy technician certification](http://www.ptcb.org/) test... ***she
passed!*** That's very cool and I'm totally proud of her. (She got a
really good score!)
