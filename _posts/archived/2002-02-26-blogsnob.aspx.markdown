So I joined this sort of ad-trading network to maybe get some traffic in
here. It seemed like a keen thing. It's called
[BlogSnob](http://blogsnob.idya.net/). Basically, you just put a little
Javascript dealie in your page (mine's in the column on the right) and
you get a random text link to someone else's blog. In return, your blog
will get advertised on other peoples' sites.
 
 Hey, I figure it can't hurt. If anything, it's something fun and
different.
