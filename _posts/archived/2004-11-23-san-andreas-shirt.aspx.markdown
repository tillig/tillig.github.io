got my [San Andreas
shirt](http://store.yahoo.com/rockstarwarehouse/sanandreastee.html)
delivered yesterday, and I'm proudly sporting it today. Didn't hurt *at
all* that it came with two six-inch-square San Andreas logo stickers and
[an 18-inch-square San Andreas
kerchief](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pLQsBJbak_FzdAg4g7QQH5O8V2mQcJL8uc3X7ylncSXrlirWsu9tynZWknUEG2IkBWsMuEzXxDamDhJw3vt8oqock8_7ouyaf59ER4yJJMVw/20041123sakerchief.jpg?psid=1).
It is, for lack of a better word, *the bomb*. Had I known all the extra
stuff came with it, I'd have ordered sooner.
