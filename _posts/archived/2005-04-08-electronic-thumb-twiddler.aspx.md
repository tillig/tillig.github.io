Someone needs to make a combination of the [Powerball
Gyroscope](http://www.powerballs.com/) and a
[thumb-twiddler](http://www.stumpyoriginals.com/catalog/item/1315292/783666.htm).
An electronic thumb-twiddler, sort of. You could have it twiddle your
thumbs *for you*. There could be a web site where people post their TPM
(twiddles-per-minute) measurements. "Hey, check this out - I can twiddle
my thumbs at 11,000 times per minute!" Work meetings would take on a
whole new dimension. There'd be a constant subtle hum as everyone in the
room worked on their twiddle rankings.

 A revolution, I tell you!
