Took Jenn out for a nice dinner at
[Oba](http://www.obarestaurant.com/home.html) (our favorite restaurant)
on Friday night and somewhere between the macadamia nut encrusted
swordfish and the Kahlua and cream I asked her to marry me.
 
 We've been together like five and a half years, living together for
most of that, so I figured it was probably time. It was a complete
surprise to her, which I think is cool. It was a really hard secret to
keep - only [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and my parents knew
about it. (Stu even went with me to pick out the ring at [The Shane
Company](http://www.shaneco.com), where, by the way, you should do all
of your jewelry shopping - they rock.)
 
 She said yes, which wasn't necessarily unexpected but was really nice
to hear.
 
 And somehow the restaurant figured out what was going on and comped us
our dessert, which was exceptionally thoughtful. I think my new scam
might be going from restaurant to restaurant trying to get comped
desserts.
 
 No date has been set, no plans have been made. I'll post updates as
they become available. (I'm currently a big fan of the [Paris Las Vegas
Eiffel Tower observation deck
wedding](http://www.caesars.com/Paris/LasVegas/Weddings/WeddingChapels/EiffelTowerWedding.htm)...)
