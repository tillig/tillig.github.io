Sandcastle, the documentation generator for XML doc comments in .NET,
has [released its source code on
CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle) starting with the May 2008
release. It had [gotten booted from
CodePlex](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2008/06/06/sandcastle-project-removed-from-codeplex.aspx)
for not releasing the source, so [they released
it](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2008/07/02/sandcastle-source-code-published-in-codeplex.aspx).

Somehow I don't think releasing the source is going to help anything.
It's still crap that you have to run like 10 different commands and have
a specially-tailored configuration fileÂ to get docs to render and that
they leave it up to the community to fill such a huge gap with projects
like [Sandcastle Help File Builder](http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB). I've
had to set up Sandcastle in several builds now and I always dread it
because it's such a nightmare even with helper programs like that. Sigh.
