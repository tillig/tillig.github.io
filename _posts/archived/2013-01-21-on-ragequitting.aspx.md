[Jeff Atwood just posted an
article](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/01/the-end-of-ragequitting.html)
about Aaron Swartz, his unfortunate story, and the notion of
ragequitting.

I agree with Jeff on Swartz and the thoughts about that case. Rather
than restate all that, [check out the
article](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/01/the-end-of-ragequitting.html).
My thoughts go out to Swartz and his family. He'll be missed.

What I disagree with is this:

> Ragequitting is childish, a sign of immaturity.

We've often used "[vote with your
feet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_voting)" as an idiom describing
how people can effectively support (or show lack of support) for a
thing, particularly an internet (or programming, or technology) thing.
It occurs to me that ragequitting, while abrupt, is effectively
foot-voting-in-action. I've done it myself, I admit, and I'm sure you
have, too. Point is, just because it's fast or unannounced doesn't mean
it's any less valid, and, in my opinion, certainly doesn't mean it's
childish. It's within everyone's rights to choose their situation and
decide what's best for them regardless of the emotion that may be
associated with said decision.
