A bit ago I mentioned how [Lockergnome](http://www.lockergnome.com) is
[sowing fear, uncertainty, and doubt in
newbies](/archive/2004/01/09/lockergnome-sowing-fud.aspx) regarding
security and the World Wide Web. I mailed the editor of the newsletter
and he said he'd post my rebuttal (since the original author didn't have
a functional email address) in the next issue of the newsletter.

 I just checked the next issue, and my comments aren't there.

 I remember a time I subscribed to that newsletter and actually got some
useful information out of it. Whatever happened to Lockergnome, man?
