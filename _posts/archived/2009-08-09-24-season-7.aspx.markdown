[![24: Seaosn
7](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519j1L3YRWL._SL500_AA240_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L5SRJE?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001L5SRJE)Saturday
marked another *24* marathon, this time for [season
7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L5SRJE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mhsvortex&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001L5SRJE).
As with [last time](/archive/2007/12/17/24-season-6.aspx), my dad and I
made it all the way through while Jenn missed the last couple of
episodes. We started at 8:00a on Saturday and finished up just
after 1:00a on Sunday.

I thought this was a pretty good season. I still think season 2 is my
favorite, but there were plenty of twists and turns in this one and I
enjoyed seeing some of the characters from previous seasons return.

I maintain that this is really the only way to see it - in a marathon -
since there is so much going on you really can't track it all if you're
waiting a week or more between episodes. Plus, the commercials - I mean,
that's seven hours of commercials over the course of the season that we
didn't have to deal with.

Assuming there's not another writer's strike and that [Kiefer Sutherland
doesn't land back in
jail](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20240995,00.html), I'm
looking forward to doing this again next season. We didn't get a
marathon last year and I kind of missed it.
