[Three months ago](/archive/2004/10/26/110-lunch.aspx) I went on this
ridiculous mission to replace my headlights. The driver's side had gone
out.

 Well, it's out again.

 I considered that this is pretty quick to lose a headlight, but if you
think of the law of averages, I gotta chalk this one up to bad luck. So,
I'm after another new headlight. This time I won't be replacing both,
though.

 That said, I've been to almost every auto parts store in the area and
none of them have the kind of headlight I want in stock ([Sylvania
H1ST](http://www.sylvania.com/ConsumerProducts/AutomotiveLighting/HighPerformance/Silverstar/ProductLine/default.htm)).
I was going to go out searching some more today (the quest started last
night) but the roads are all iced over, so I'm staying home, watching
movies.

 I will return to the quest on the morrow. And rest well knowing that I
will prevail.
