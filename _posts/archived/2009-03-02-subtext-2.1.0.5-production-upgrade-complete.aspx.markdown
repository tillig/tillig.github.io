This is my first post on the upgraded blog using [Subtext
2.1.0.5](http://www.subtextproject.com). After [a failed
upgrade](/archive/2008/08/16/failed-to-upgrade-to-subtext-2.0.aspx), I
ran through an upgrade [on aÂ full staging
environment](/archive/2009/02/27/subtext-2.1.0.5-staged-upgrade-complete.aspx),
got it working, and repeated the process in production... huh, I guess
that's sort of what you're supposed to do, anyway, isn't it?

I won't lie; my heart was pounding near out of my chest while I was
doing the upgrade, scared I'd have to call upon my web host to restore
me from a backup (I don't have admin access so I can't do it myself).

Right-o. Anyway, it looks like I'm up and running, which rocks, and I
like the new features. Only issue I've run into so far: The HTML editor
in the admin interface doesn't really work with Firefox. Specifically,
when you try to add a hyperlink to something, the little "edit
hyperlink" box pops up, but when you click "OK" the box doesn't dismiss
and the hyperlink gets made into some crazy JavaScript placeholder link.
Solution: Post using IE.

If you see soemthing wrong with the site, leave me a comment or contact
me (see the link in the navigation bar) so I can see about fixing it.
