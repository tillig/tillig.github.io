The company has decided that they not only need to have me on call 24/7
via phone and throw requests at me constantly via email, but now I need
to be bombarded by "real-time spam" via Windows Instant Messenger.
 
 They're putting in a Real-Time Communication Server (or whatever
Microsoft is calling their IM server nowadays) and we all get special IM
clients to log into this thing.
 
 The problem I have is that whenever I have my Instant Messenger logged
in, everyone sees that I'm marked as online and as soon as I sign on, I
get accosted by thirty bazillion messages. The thought process I'm sure
goes something like this:
 
 *Hey! Travis just logged on. Obviously he has nothing better to do than
to answer my questions or respond to instant messages. I wonder how he's
doing? I'll just send him a quick 'Hey, dude, what's up?' style message
to let him know I'm here. He's obviously too stupid to look at the list
of his contacts and **see** that I'm online.*
 
 It's pretty ridiculous.
 
 The other thing I notice is that if I leave the thing logged in (as I
am wont to do because logging in and out is just one more thing I don't
want to deal with), it could be, like, 1:00a and people will see that my
IM is logged in (even if the status is set to "Busy" or something) and
will send the ol' "Hey, Dude!" messages. I'll come in the next morning
and see a load of messages cluttering my desktop from the insomniacs in
my life.
 
 And then they complain that I never responded to their messages. Bah.
 
 The answer is that they need to add one more status to the list of
possible statuses. See, "Busy" doesn't work. "Appear Offline" sometimes
works, but defeats the purpose of presence information. I need something
that says... "I'm online, but I sure as shit don't want to hear from
you." Something like this:

 Until then, I think I'll just skip the whole IM thing. It's more
trouble than its worth.
