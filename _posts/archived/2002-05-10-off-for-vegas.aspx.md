[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 4]

 Well, for all intents and purposes, I'm off to Vegas. I won't be adding
to the blog over the weekend, I'm taking Monday to pack, rest up, etc.,
and Tuesday through Friday of next week, it's *Viva Las Vegas*.

 For those who care (on a whole different note):

 I just got a call from the [Acura
dealership](http://www.acuraofportland.com/) and they have my car ready,
which is cool. It'll be good to have it back, since they stuck me with
this [Enterprise](http://www.enterprise.com/) Rent-A-Clown-Car. It's a
[four-door
Corolla](http://www.enterprise.com/car_rental/cars/compact.jhtml) that I
have to fold myself into a
[contortionist](http://www.contortionhomepage.com/) position to get
into. And the gas and brake pedals are so close together it's hard to
tell where one stops and the other starts.

 Anyway, it'll be nice to be able to *drive* again. Even if I was only
without my car for a few hours.

 And a final sidetrack before I sign off for a week: Today is [Fred
Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com) employee double-discount day so I get
20% off anything (except food and pharmacy) at Freddy's via my mom. She
had an extra coupon for 10% additional off any DVDs, so I picked up [The
Godfather
trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXAA/mhsvortex)
for a bargain - normal price is $75, I got it for $54. Can't complain
about that - $21 extra dollars to spend in *VEGAS*!
