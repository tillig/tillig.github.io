[![The Killers - Day & Age](https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61CK4wp-HTL._SL160_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FWRZ46?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001FWRZ46)

Jenn
and I went to see The Killers last night at [the Memorial
Coliseum](http://www.rosequarter.com/). It was awesome.

Now, the opening bands - there were two - not so great. First up was
[The Nervous Wreckords](http://www.thenervouswreckords.com/), which we
were a little late for, and Jenn fairly accurately described as "15
minutes of pain." After that came [Mariachi El
Bronx](http://www.thebronxxx.com/), which was sort of modern-ish
mariachi music. I didn't think they were horrible (Jenn did), but it
wasn't great, either.

The Killers, on the other hand, put on an awesome show. They sang all
the hits from their albums as well as a few lesser known songs. Jenn and
I did our little "stand up by your seat and bob your head" dances for
part of it. The thing I noticed was how*into it* their drummer gets. The
guy's a wildman - great on the drums and really fun to watch.

The crowd was great, really into the whole thing, and all-in-all it was
a fantastic show. Totally worth the price of admission.

Jenn got her very first concert shirt ever at this show, too, so a
groundbreaking experience was had by all.
