I've been on allergy immunotherapy shots for about three years now to
lower my susceptibility to dust, pollen, and animal allergic reaction. I
went in yesterday to get tested and I'm finally done!

 The doctor says it's possible for symptoms to come back in three to
five years, though, and if they do I need to go back on shots. That's
fine; not being bothered come grass season is the most awesome feeling
ever. We never were able to get my skin tests down to zero reaction
(except on animal allergens - I really improved there) but I can't
complain.

 Minor detour/gripe: I was listening to the radio yesterday and heard a
Tom Jones cover of the song "Black Betty." Being a closet Tom Jones fan,
I have several albums, but didn't have this song. Turns out it's on [a
greatest hits
album](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DD55G/mhsvortex). Not
wanting the whole album (because I have all the songs from it on the
other albums I own), I went to iTunes to see if I could just get the one
song. They sell it as a "partial album" - every song *except* the two I
don't already have. So if I want it, I have to buy the whole album on
CD. Lame, guys, *really lame*.
