It's been a heck of a busy week, so I haven't had a chance to blog about
the wedding I went to this past weekend.
 
 Saturday Jenn and I packed up and headed to Puyallup, WA, to see my
cousin Haley get married. The ceremony was at [High Cedars Golf
Club](http://www.highcedars.com/). It was a nice ceremony, though the
minister seemed a little frazzled like he had never performed a marriage
ceremony before. Regardless, congratulations to Haley and Adam Horton.
 
 Immediately following the wedding there was a minor incident involving
Adam running over Haley's dress with a golf cart and ripping the back on
it, but a few safety pins later and Adam's first married-life "I'm
sorry," everything was back in order.
 
 The real excitement came when we checked into our hotel up there. We
stayed at the [Crossland Economy
Studios](http://www.crosslandstudios.com/) up there because we knew the
wedding would go reasonably late and we didn't want to drive the three
hours back that night.
 
 When we made the reservation, they offered us our choice of a room with
two double beds or a room with two queen beds. A double's a little
small, so I picked the room with two queens. When we got there, they
told me the hotel was packed, so rather than getting one room with two
beds, they had me in two rooms, each with one bed, where each room would
only cost me half price. Not needing two beds, I told the clerk I only
needed one of the rooms. The cool part - I got to keep the half price.
So I stayed there for \$35, including tax.
 
 The not so cool part - the bed was a freaking *double*. Oh, and the
mattress was firm, sort of in the sense that a sheet of plywood laying
on cement is firm. But, hey, \$35, right?
 
 We had a decent drive home the next day (though the trip south on I-5
is one of the most boring drives ever) and spent most of the day Sunday
lounging on the couch, exhausted.
