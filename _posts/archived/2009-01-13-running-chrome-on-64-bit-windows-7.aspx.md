I saw this over on
[Gizmodo](http://i.gizmodo.com/5130150/how-to-run-chrome-on-64+bit-windows-7)
(who saw it on
[BlogsDNA](http://www.blogsdna.com/1900/how-to-run-google-chrome-on-windows-7-64-bit-version.htm))
and thought it'd be worth passing along. I haven't gotten a chance to
run Windows 7 myself, but for those who have and want to get [Google
Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) running on the 64-bit version, you
need to add the "**--in-process-plugins**" parameter to the chrome.exe
command line.
