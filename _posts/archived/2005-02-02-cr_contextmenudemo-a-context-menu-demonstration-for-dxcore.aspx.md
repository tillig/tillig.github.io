Use of context menus from within the [DXCore plugin
framework](http://www.devexpress.com/dxcore) (used to extend Visual
Studio .NET) is not very well documented within the DXCore developer
documentation.

I have a need to use context menus in some planned enhancements to my
[CR_Documentor
plugin](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx).
I got an example of generallly how it works, but nothing that compiles
and actually does anything... so I wrote one myself.

Enter CR_ContextMenuDemo: Source for a compilable DXCore plugin that
illustrates how context menus can be used from within the DXCore plugin
framework. The source is well commented to illustrate precisely what is
happening in each place. You'd be surprised how easy it is to use
context menus in DXCore.
