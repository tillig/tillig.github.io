mentioned that we were watching
[*Wonderfalls*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GAO18/mhsvortex)
lately. We finished last night with the last episode, and I feel like I
should start watching them all over again.
 
 *Wonderfalls* is the story of Jaye Tyler, played by [Caroline
Dhavernas](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223518/), who is a Generation-Y
college graduate with a philosophy degree. She's stuck, dissatisfied
with life (and only slightly bitter), living in a trailer park and
working retail at a Niagara Falls souvenir shop.
 
 One day inanimate animal shaped objects start talking to her (a wax
lion, a monkey bookend, a lizard puppet) and, through their cryptic
guidance, Jaye ends up helping people.
 
 I won't say much more than that because while it sounds like a sort of
lame premise, you'd be absolutely astounded at how well it works. The
characters are all lovable, the writing is solid, the acting is solid...
in fact, I'd have to say *Wonderfalls* rates as one of my all-time
favorite TV shows.
 
 Unfortunately, Fox cancelled the show after airing only four of the 13
episodes. Lucky for fans, they released all 13 on DVD and you can see
what you missed. Once you see it, you'll understand why folks think Fox
is absolutely stupid for making some of the decisions it makes.
 
 However unfortunately the cancellation of the show was, one thing
you'll like is that the first season is a completely contained story.
They didn't leave any cliffhangers at the end, so when you finish
watching the 13th episode, you'll get the closure you seek. They could
have run with it in a second season, but the first season does wind up
nicely.
 
 [Definitely pick one
up](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GAO18/mhsvortex); you
can't beat it.
