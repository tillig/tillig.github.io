[Greg posted some great
video](http://www.greghughes.net/rant/FireworksShowVideoWallaWallaWashingtonJuly42007.aspx)
that one of the crewmembers, Cassie, took during [the fireworks show we
did this
year](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2007/07/06/walla-walla-fireworks-2007.aspx). 
It's pretty cool.  About 1:15 into the video, it zooms down and you can
see the line of mortar racks and four people standing a few yards back
from where it's all going off.  I'm standing in that group with a road
flare on the end of a stick (not lit), waiting to ensure that everything
goes off.  (If one of the shells doesn't go off electronically, I get to
light up the flare and run out and light it by hand.  Fortunately that
didn't happen.)
