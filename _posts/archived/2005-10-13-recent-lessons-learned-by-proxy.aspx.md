I've learned a few lessons from watching others in the last couple of
days that I thought may benefit the readers here.

 From watching a lady on the news: If a person in a car that *almost*
looks like a cop car (but has no markings) flashes a *yellow* light at
you to pull you over, then comes up to your car in what *almost* looks
like a police uniform (but with no badge or gear and no other markings)
and tells you that he's giving you a ticket but you can go ahead and pay
him in cash right now if you want... I learned that the person *probably
isn't a cop and you shouldn't pay him*.

 From yesterday in line at the lottery ticket machine:

 If you try to feed two perfectly crisp new $20 bills into the machine
and it won't take them, chances are the machine just doesn't like the
new $20s - trying six different $20s in all possible directions *isn't
going to make the machine like them*.

 If you have a bill that's run through the wash so many times you can
barely make out the print on it, *the machine isn't going to take it*.

 If you have a bill that is missing a huge chunk out of the corner, is
nearly torn in half, or has lived its life crinkled into a ball the size
of a dime and jammed into the bottom of your purse, *the machine isn't
going to take it*.

 If the lottery machine allows you to build up a credit by feeding
multiple bills in, you don't need to feed one dollar in at a time and
purchase 350 one-dollar tickets. You can do all the bill feeding up
front and buy several larger tickets to save time. No, seriously, you
can.

 If you aren't just buying the random set of lottery numbers and the
sheet you've marked your numbers on - which the lottery machine has to
automatically scan - is torn, destroyed, or if you decided not to follow
the instructions and mark your sheet within the defined lines, *the
machine isn't going to take it, even if you try to put it in 10 or more
times*.

 (All of these lottery machine lessons were learned from the
three-person family immediately in front of me in line.)

 Anyway, I hope you can all learn from this. I know it was all very
educational for me.
