[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 29]

 I realized this weekend while talking to Jenn that my random and
frequent pop culture references have, for some, no context and thus mean
pretty much *squat*.

 Why I figured everyone knew what [Happy Fun
Ball](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/tv/sat-night-live/commercials/) is, I
have no clue. But when I told Jenn not to taunt Happy Fun Ball, she just
didn't *get* it.

 I had quite the eventful weekend. Let's see...

 Jenn and I went to see the new Samuel L. Jackson/Ben Affleck movie,
*[Changing Lanes](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264472)*. It was pretty
good, though not quite what either of us expected. It looks like a lot
more cloak-and-dagger style action, whereas it's more of an intense
drama with bonus intrigue. Maybe later I'll write up a little review.

 On the whole movie tip, we also watched *[Spy
Game](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0266987)* and *[Enemy of the
State](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120660)*. For some reason, spy movies
just never get old to me. I can't quite put my finger on why, though.

 In the vein of [Grand Theft Auto
3](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/), I completed the last
major mission ("The Exchange") and watched the credits roll. I thought
it was a pretty cool ending, just like a gangster movie. The really cool
thing is, since I hadn't finished 100% of the game (I still have certain
cars to jack, certain stunts to perform, etc.), after the credits rolled
I was returned to my hideout one million dollars richer and I can
continue playing until I've got 100% done. Last I checked I was at,
like, 65%. I think I have a while.

 I picked up the game *[Rez](http://rez.u-ga.com/)* this weekend. As if
I don't have enough to do with GTA3. But Rez is pretty darn cool - I got
a demo of it from the latest issue of *Official Playstation Magazine*
and it sucked me in. My dad wasn't so enticed by it, but he's not a big
music lover, either, and music plays a major part in this one. Great
techno here, and the way the game works (for those who don't know), the
music is *interactive*. You make it by performing actions in the game.
Very cool.

 (I just downloaded the Rez "homepage design kit" from the Rez site.
Maybe I'll whip myself up a little Rez tribute page because it's so
cool.)

 For those who care about my [turntable
issues](/archive/2002/03/25/through-the-whirlwind.aspx), I ended up
having to take the stupid thing in for professional service at [Fred's
Sound of Music](http://www.fredsoundofmusic.com). It'll cost me $30 for
a new stylus and between $45 and $75 for the repairs. That figures.
But, after all is said and done, even with the $55 I spent on getting a
like model to cannibalize (that didn't work, either), I'm still getting
out spending less than it would cost for a brand new turntable of that
quality. So I suppose I can't complain. Too much.
