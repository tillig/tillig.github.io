I just completed [a new version of the SPS Search
Test](/archive/2004/06/18/sharepoint-portal-server-2003-search-web-service-tester.aspx)
and put it out there for download. It now supports syntax highlighting
for your SQL queries. [Go get
it!](/archive/2004/06/18/sharepoint-portal-server-2003-search-web-service-tester.aspx)
