The ice looks like it's starting to melt off, but I just watched a 4x4
spin all of its wheels trying to get through our parking lot. I saw that
they started the bus running outside the apartment this afternoon, so
some people must think it's getting better.

 I called [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com) to get my cable Internet
service running but the account's in Jenn's name so I have to call back
with her and have her either order it or authorize me on the account so
I can order it. I think I'll just have her put me on the account so I
can call them whenever I want and get service or handle problems.

 Regardless, it's supposed to warm up this weekend so by Monday we won't
have the ice or snow anymore and I'll be able to take my time setting up
the high-speed Internet. That's going to rock; I can hardly wait.

 I thought I had mentioned it before, but searching back through my blog
I don't see where... Anyway, when I got my new computer, I hooked it up
and all was well. For a while, though, my 21" monitor was having these
odd brightness/contrast issues where it would be totally bright and hard
to look at even with the brightness turned all the way down to 0. I
noticed that I had my speakers parked kinda close to the monitor, so I
moved them away and that seemed to fix things. Turns out, I think that
was more of a coincidence than anything because it's doing it again. I
suppose the monitor has probably reached the end of its natural
lifetime. I've had it for... uh... like 7 or 8 years now. I think I paid
like $1000 for it at the time, though, so that averages out to almost
$125/year for the thing. I'd like it to last longer. I guess I'll ride
it out until it's so bright you just really can't use it, then I'll buy
something new. I've got my eye on one of the LCD flat panel monitors -
save me some desk space - but they're so expensive. That's something
I'll really have to think on.
