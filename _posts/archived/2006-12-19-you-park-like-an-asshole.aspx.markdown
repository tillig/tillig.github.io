UPDATE: It appears that the "youparklikeanasshole" site I visited[is
actually an infringment](http://coldcockedcards.com/blog/?p=1) on an
[existing
product](http://www.coldcockedcards.com/shop/leaveBehinds.html) that has
been sold for a while. I've removed the link to the site out of respect
to the original idea distributors, however my two cents:

 First, when I was in grade school a friend of mine gave me a
"leave-behind" that looked veeeery similar to this. It didn't actually
say "you park like an asshole" on it, but it did refer to the driver as
an asshole and had a checklist of infringements on it. That was over 20
years ago, and somehow I'm in doubt that it was produced by [Cold Cocked
Cards](http://www.coldcockedcards.com/). It looked like one of those
jokes you see posted on the wall of your local auto body shop,
photocopied to death. If I recall correctly, it had Mickey Mouse on it
with his middle finger out.

 Second, the addition that the youparklikeanasshole site provided that
made it cool was the ability to upload and categorize photos of the
asshole parkers. Connecting the real-world leave-behind to the online
world is a great idea and is what pushed it over the top from an
"interesting idea" to a "cool site." It might be in [Cold Cocked
Cards](http://www.coldcockedcards.com/) best interest to either partner
with youparklikeanasshole or settle or something because the photo
upload thing is an idea that shouldn't be missed.

 Anyway, it sucks when someone steals your idea, so I hope things pan
out for everyone involved.


 Original entry...

 My friend [John](http://www.johnbatdorf.net/blog/) just sent me to my
new favorite site: youparklikeanasshole.com. Maybe I should submit some
of my [Traffic Assholes](/) to this one.
