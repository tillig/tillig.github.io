I decided, since I've fought enough with SharePoint Portal Server 2003
today to last three lifetimes, that, in the immortal words of
McDonald's, "I deserve a break today." Though not necessarily in the
implied proverbial "McDonald's Way." Instead, I went to the cafeteria
and got myself a pepperoni and garlic pizza, a favorite among my
colleagues in the department.

 Jenn and I watched a movie last night,
[*Holes*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLYQ/mhsvortex).
It's a family movie, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't feel
cheated out of my time like I usually do with family films. The
character played by [Jon Voight](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Voight,+Jon)
reminded me very much of my grandfather, which was a little scary.

 I got notification today from Microsoft that I'm officially a Microsoft
Certified Application Developer in .NET, and I should be getting my
certificate (suitable for framing) in the mail shortly. That's cool; it
signifies that I'm making progress, which I like.

 I think Jenn and I will be going boating this weekend with some friends
of ours that we haven't seen for a long time. It'll be good to get out,
and even better to see them again. Fun stuff.

 While cruising around, I found [this site called
JList](http://www.jlist.com) that carries all sorts of Japanese
contraband of dubious nature. They've got some Domokun stuff on there,
which is cool but expensive, as well as some... interesting
"photobooks," as they call them. Heh.
