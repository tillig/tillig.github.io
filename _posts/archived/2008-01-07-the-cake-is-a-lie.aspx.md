I am, I'm sure, somewhere around the last person to get on board with
this, but still. I got [The Orange
Box](http://www.whatistheorangebox.com) for Xbox 360 for Christmas and,
after hearing about
[Portal](http://www.whatistheorangebox.com/portal.html) from a lot of
folks, I finally got a chance to play it this weekend.

It's awesome.

I'd played *Half-Life* before, and *Counter-Strike*, and all that, but
this is way, way different. Basically, it's a first-person puzzle game,
which is something I'd never come across before.

![The Orange Box:
Portal](https://hyqi8g.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2pMDYyHOq5FsxNnYNAYRhoYTuTZKrcZvfGFcxaArqhj4RkZg6m88gNtB2tnEMD_31oZ_Dvq03MeKuXX74y6hbBgZ2V_hRmpuRYKXy6pGc-zXI/20080107portal.jpg?psid=1)The
idea is that you are in a testing facility for a company called
"Aperture Science." You've got a gun that shoots, basically, "holes."
You shoot a wall, and a hole appears. Then you shoot a different wall
and the other side of the hole appears. Walk through one hole, you come
out the other.

Think about that for a second and imagine the possibilities - it's not
just the walls you can shoot. Shoot the ceiling and the floor, then jump
in. You fall through the ceiling to the floor... through that hole and
back through the ceiling... and you keep falling infinitely. Or shoot
the wall across the room and the floor below you - fall through the
floor and get propelled out the wall across the room.

You use your portal gun to solve puzzles in the testing facility getting
from the entry to the exit of each room. As you progress, you learn more
and more about the testers and Aperture Science. And then... well, you
just have to play. It's the perfect blend of difficulty, humor, fun, and
originality. (The subject of the post is a reference to one of the
little jokes in the game.) Plus, the song at the end credits is probably
the best video game song ever.

The only problem I had with it was that it was too short. I beat the
standard game in like four hours or something. After you beat it, there
are challenges you unlock (advanced versions of the puzzles you just
solved, challenges to see if you can beat the puzzles in a certain time
limit or with a minimum number of portals, etc.), but I want more story.
It was short and fantastic and I gotta have more.
