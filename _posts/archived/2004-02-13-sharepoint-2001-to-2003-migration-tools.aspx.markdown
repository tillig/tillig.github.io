Microsoft finally released some free [SharePoint Portal Server 2001 (web
storage) document library migration
tools](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=feea83b4-7f46-4040-bce2-5341e5c1b107&displaylang=en)
that copy all the data into SharePoint Portal Server 2003 (SQL) document
libraries.

 This is some seriously good news, considering that [the alternative,
AvePoint's DocAve Migrator
2.0](http://www.avepoint.com/website/product.html), is licensed per
object migrated.
