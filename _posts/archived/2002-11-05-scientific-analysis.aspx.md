[I have the worst headache right now, and I'm not sure if it's from a
lack of caffeine or too much caffeine. I'm feeding it coffee and
Excedrin Migraine to see if it will go away. If anything, hopefully I
will shortly be in a better mood.]

 Even if you are not a science nut, you should enjoy [this report on the
electron band structure in
Germanium](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/hall.html). Trust me, this is
*the bomb*. I couldn't have written it better myself. Apparently, this
guy actually turned this in. I'd have given him an A.
