[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 5]

 I love *[The Amazing
Race](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race2/)*. There's something
about a giant rally that I just sort of dig. I watched the [first
one](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race/) and had a good time
with it, and I'm having almost as good a time watching this latest
installment.

 The only problem I have is that every time I finally decide on a team
to root for, they get eliminated. In the first Amazing Race, I liked
[Kevin and
Drew](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race/teams/bios/drew.shtml)
(as did pretty much everyone else). They were entertaining, good guys
and I hoped they won. They didn't.

 This time around, I also started liking the entertaining team ([Gary
and
Dave](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race2/teams/bios/gary.shtml)),
but they got eliminated. Then I didn't know who I liked, but Team Cha
Cha Cha ([Danny and
Oswald](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race2/teams/bios/oswald.shtml))
really grew on me because they were good guys and they played the game
*smart*, no backstabbing or weaselling, just good fun.

 Well, as with *every* team I like, they got eliminated last night, and
I think that sucks. How come [Wil and
Tara](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race2/teams/bios/tara.shtml),
"Team ASSHOLE," can't be eliminated? Maybe they should merge
*[Survivor](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor4/)* with *The Amazing
Race* so the other teams can vote them off. I'd vote 'em off.

 I don't think I could ever be on one of these shows, though. I don't
have the patience with other people the way you'd have to have in order
to be successful. I think I'd have gotten into a fight with Wil already
because I'm sure he'd have done some stupid weaselly shit to me and I'd
be forced to beat him. It might make good TV but it's terrible
sportsmanship.

 In *Survivor* I don't know who I want to win right now. I like both
[Neleh](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor4/survivors/bios/neleh.shtml)
and
[Paschal](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor4/survivors/bios/paschal.shtml),
but
[Kathy](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor4/survivors/bios/kathy.shtml)'s
also got a lot going for her. I'm sure that saying that out loud has
just jinxed all three of them, but I suppose we'll see what happens when
the latest episode runs tonight.
