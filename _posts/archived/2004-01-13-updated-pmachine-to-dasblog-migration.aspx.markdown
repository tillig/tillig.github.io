Not that I've decided or anything, but it's interesting to note that
dasBlog stores its data in separate XML files, sort of similar to the
way GreyMatter stored its stuff. That would make the export from
pMachine much easier, but what about the search? Doesn't efficiency go
out the window? Makes you wonder.
