I got my [Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G
Router](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KDVI/mhsvortex)
hooked up and locked down - no SSID broadcast, MAC address filtering,
128-bit WEP encryption... so wireless networking is in the hizzouse!
I've tested it out using my laptop from work and it's awesome.

 While I was doing that, I noticed there was a new wireless network
called "Ladybug" in my area, broadcasting its SSID. I didn't try to
connect, but I find that interesting since the average age in the
apartment complex is like 90. I'm thinking it has to be the guys next
door; they're the only ones I can imagine having such a thing (they're
probably in their mid 30's).

 Anyway, I'm stoked. Wireless networking, router/firewall installed. Set
to frickin' GO.
