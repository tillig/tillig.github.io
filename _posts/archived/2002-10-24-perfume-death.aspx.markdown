There are three kinds of perfume in the world: hot and sexy; mild and
demure; and overwhelmingly terrible.
 
 [Jenn wears a perfume](/archive/2002/10/21/waxing-philosophic.aspx)
that is classified *by me* in the "hot and sexy" category. Some folks
might consider it "mild and demure." Grandmothers unfailingly pick the
"overwhelmingly terrible" category. Salespeople usually do, too. (Note
that in perfume, "more" is not always "better.")
 
 My cubicle sits adjacent to the local meeting area. We don't have a
conference room in our general location, it's more of an open air affair
- a table with a bunch of chairs. Convenient when I have a meeting to
attend; decidedly *inconvenient* when I'm trying to work and there's a
meeting going on.
 
 There's a meeting going on right now, I don't know who with, but
there's a lady over there with perfume on in the *overwhelmingly
terrible* category. I don't know what it is, but it's giving me a
migraine. I actually think I may complain to the boss over this one.
 
 Once he gets out of that meeting, that is.
