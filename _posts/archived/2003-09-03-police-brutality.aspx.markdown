So the [mayor of Portland forced the police chief to
resign](http://www.kptv.com/Global/story.asp?S=1425449) a week ago and
then had a press conference to tell us why.
 
 She said something about how there was a "rift in the community" and
that she was trying to get people to come together.
 
 This morning it clicked for me as to *why* this happened, and it looks
like [Marty](http://www.mildperil.net/blog/archives/00000039.htm) sort
of had it click, too.
 
 See, back in May, this cop pulled over [Kendra
James](http://www.oregonlive.com/special/kendrajames/), an
African-American individual who had existing drug and escape charges
against her and a warrant out for her arrest. They told her to get out
of the car, she didn't. They tried to pull her out of the car. She
wouldn't come out. Then she started *driving away*, so they shot at her.
One shot hit her and ended up killing her.
 
 Now, I don't know about you, but if the cops tell me to get out of the
car and I decide *not to* and try to *drive away*, I *fully expect them
to shoot at me*. If I end up getting killed, it's probably because I was
doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing. I mean, you get fair
warning, right? It's not like you don't know you're in trouble.
 
 Further, consider this - she'd been in and out of jail for other
robbery, theft, and drug convictions. Four times she'd been in and out
of jail for this stuff. Am I sorry they shot her? Well, I don't like the
unnecessary loss of human life in any event, but let's just say it's not
hurting my feelings that my tax dollars don't have to support her
delinquent ass in jail. Again.
 
 So, anyway, this got huge in the press around here. Holy shit, man, a
*white cop* from a precinct headed by a *white cop* shooting a *black
lady*? What is the world coming to? God forbid we try to stop the bad
people in the world, but especially don't try if they're *a
minority*...
 
 Back to the forced resignation of the police chief:
 
 The mayor said she wanted to get the community back behind the police,
and I didn't understand why the resignation of the chief would do
that... until I saw that she had appointed a black guy to be the new
chief.
 
 Huh. That's an interesting thing. Everything's going well, except for
the media coverage... but everything else is fine - the chief's doing a
decent job and wants to continue doing so. The media goes south, and
we've got a new police chief. Funny how things work.
 
 For the record, I *hate* racism. I think it's a deplorable act to be
prejudiced against someone based on the color of their skin (or, really,
for any other reason - I'm totally in favor of tolerance and acceptance
for all). And if you're a criminal, you should get what's coming to you.
Regardless of your skin color. If you run from the cops, you're taking
that risk on yourself. It's not the police's fault you decided to resist
arrest. And it's not the color of your skin that's making you rip off
the local liquor store. Face up to your responsibilities and accept the
consequences of your actions, people. Things would work a lot smoother
around here if you would.
