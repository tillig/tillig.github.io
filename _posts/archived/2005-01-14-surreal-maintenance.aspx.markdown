While waiting for [*CSI*](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/) to come on
last night, Jenn and I were flipping channels and came across [*The
Surreal
Life*](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_surreal_life_4/series.jhtml).
I'd never watched the show before so I didn't know what to expect, other
than folks said it was pretty funny. This was the season four opener, so
I figured it'd be a good intro to what's what.
 
 Holy
 
 Shit.
 
 Honestly, I could not stop laughing. The ridiculousness of the whole
thing was overwhelming. See, they've got a couple of halfway normal
folks on there ([Christopher Knight](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0460843/)
and [Da Brat](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0004771/) seem to have things
reasonably together), and then you've got [Verne
Troyer](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0873942/) and [Joanie
Laurer](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0491321/) on the other side of that
logic boundary.
 
 Let's just say this: The show ended with Verne Troyer - Mini-Me -
drunk, naked, sitting on a scooter peeing in the corner of the living
room. Seriously. There's video of it on VH1's site. [Check it
out](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_surreal_life_4/88629/episode.jhtml).
 
 [My driver's side headlight is out
again](/archive/2004/10/26/110-lunch.aspx), so that's some more car
maintenance I didn't want to deal with. I'm kind of irritated about it,
but what are you going to do?
 
 Jenn handed me a yogurt for breakfast this morning. I got to work and
saw it was way expired. That and the headlight are shaping my day up
nicely.
 
 My [Bose Acoustimass
16's](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006L7RX/mhsvortex) are
going to be in at the store tonight, so I've got to go pick those up. I
have to look at that as the bright spot in my day, even if it is costing
me a bit.
 
 My [M4P Backup
script](/archive/2004/12/29/m4p-backupdecryption-script.aspx) has
[problems now that iTunes 4.7.1 has come
out](http://www.hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=430) (because
hymn, which I use for automated unlocking of the protected files,
doesn't support stripping of individual tags), but I don't see any
releases of [hymn](http://www.hymn-project.org/) approaching to fix the
issue, so that may mean switching to
[JHymn](http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/) and just using a proper
combination of options there to get the job done. I kinda wish there was
a command-line interface to JHymn, or that hymn itself would be updated
with some additional switches, but I'm not prepared to put in the work
myself to get that to happen.
