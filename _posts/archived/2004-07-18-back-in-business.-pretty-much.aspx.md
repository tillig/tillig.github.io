Well, I've got Windows up, I've got Office installed (and updating),
I've got my antivirus software in place, and everything seems to be
generally functioning. A few more apps, a little more customization, and
I'm back in business.
 
 If anything, this has taught me something: I'm going to store my user
data on a different partition (or physical disk - even better!) than the
OS. If it goes tits up on me again, at least I won't lose my data.
