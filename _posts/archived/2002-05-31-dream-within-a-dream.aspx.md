![Britney Spears - FRONT ROW
TICKET!](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pEkehj8rWIMHBkNEbykSZPhvCSJqqLHvRBvjPQTsXOjH36TWydFg7z1haRX5ANKbwNKRaAqtVI7hZmUSjjAutLRjjGfYCB0UYaV6pTiUQbow/20020531britticketwy5.jpg?psid=1)I
didn't really expect to be where I was last night.
 
 I got an email from a friend of mine that I used to work with. I hadn't
heard from her for a while, so it was good to chat. She mailed me to
tell me that her boyfriend had some sort of connection and had gotten
them two reasonably decent seats at the [Britney
Spears](http://www.britneyspears.com/) "Dream Within A Dream" show, but
he had to return to Seattle for some business so she wanted to know if I
would go.
 
 A free ticket to a Britney show? Too good to pass up. I accepted.
 
 We met up before the show with some other friends who were going that
night, too. They had some great seats just off the floor. I asked my
friend where her tickets were, but she didn't know. They were at the
Will Call desk and we needed to pick them up and find out.
 
 We got to the Will Call desk and picked up the tickets. *Row 3*. Can't
get much better than that. I was stoked.
 
 When we got *into* the [Rose Garden](http://www.rosequarter.com),
though, it turns out that, sure, we were in the third row the way the
seat numbering went, but by the way the stage was laid out, we were in
the ***front row***. I was maybe 10 - 12 feet away from the stage
(reads: 10 - 12 feet away from *Britney*), and the only thing between me
and her was the security guard. *Holy crap!* (You can see where I was
sitting in [this diagram](http://sdrv.ms/14jY34K).)
 
 So I turned to my friend and asked, "So, your boyfriend just 'knows'
people? Who's your boyfriend?" Turns out he's the guitarist for
*freaking [Pearl Jam](http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/)*,
Stone Gossard. Apparently they grew up near each other in Seattle and
they met at the wedding of a mutual friend. *How weird is that?!*
 
 Anyway, the show was *awesome*. Britney played all of her hits ("Baby,
One More Time," "Oops!... I Did It Again," etc.). The costumes were
*spectacular*. There were pyrotechnics of all natures - columns of fire
shooting up, fireworks, sparks... There were lasers *all over the
place*... There was even a part in the show where it *rained on stage*.
Lots of props - Britney came out at one part in a giant music box,
popped out of the top, and was the ballerina in the music box. She swung
from giant bungee cords, she levitated on platforms. Incredible.
 
 The backup singers rocked, the band rocked, the dancers rocked (one
danced for some time right in front of me, lookin' right at me). My
friend even claims she saw Britney wink at me, but I can't confirm that
one. Absolutely unbelieveable. I wish I could have recorded it so I
could share it with you all, but, alas, no cameras.
 
 An evening at home watching TV turned into an evening at a really great
concert. I feel bad for Jenn, who "got" to stay home and do the TV
thing, but she's not into Britney like I am. I told my friend to give
Stone a big high-five for me. That made my day.
