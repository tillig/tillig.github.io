A fairly popular articleÂ I posted a couple years back is on setting up
iTunes for multiple users on Windows. I just updated that article so it
shows how to do it in XP and in Vista, and I fleshed out the steps so
they're easier to understand and follow. (I just had to do this on a new
laptop we bought, so I figured I'd offer it up to folks and see if I
could spread the joy.)
