After some unfortunate problems with the handling of medium trust,
[Subtext has released a new
version](http://code.google.com/p/subtext/downloads/list) to which I've
upgraded.

Things seem to be working reasonably well with the exception of email. I
no longer actually receive emails coming from the Contact form, nor do I
get notified when comments are made. I gather I'm not the only person
with the problem, either.

I'm working on that, but in the meantime... sorry. [Catch me on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/tillig) if you need to get in touch or send
me email directly: tillig-at-paraesthesia-dot-com.

I do love me some Subtext, but I have to admit things like this make me
lose faith. There's a lot of "works on my machine in full trust" that
sort of makes survival on Subtext in a medium trust world a bit
problematic. I'm glad I have a staging machine to try things out on or
I'd never be able to upgrade.
