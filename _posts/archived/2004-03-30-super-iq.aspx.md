I do surveys and tests and crap online when I find them. I'm a sucker, I
admit it.
 
 I just took this "[Super IQ
Test](http://web.tickle.com/tests/superiq/)" over at
[Tickle](http://web.tickle.com/) and got 147, which is pretty much in
line with every other IQ test I've taken since grade school. Apparently,
I'm also a "Visual Linguist." Here's the longer description:

> The way you think about things makes you a Visual Linguist. This means
> you are highly intelligent and have many diverse talents. You have
> especially strong linguistic talents and are very good at interpreting
> visual information. You've got your feet on the ground, but your mind
> is capable of very complex, abstract thought. Compared to others, you
> are easily able to see situations from many different angles. You also
> understand how things work in a very practical way.

The real kicker came in an email later, though:

> **Visual Linguists know what they know and don't particularly enjoy
> having to explain why or how.**

That's probably the most accurate statement any test ever has come up
with. It's *exactly* how I function. I know what I know, just trust me
and don't make me explain it to you. All it's doing is wasting your time
and mine.
