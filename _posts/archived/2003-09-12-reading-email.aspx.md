I got in this morning, all ready to *get down to it*, if you know what I
mean, when I got a call from one of our sales guys saying that there was
a problem with this event registration app I have running - a customer
tried to register and got an error.

 On quick investigation I found that in the new site conversion, a part
of this app was overlooked. No biggie, this was a chance to improve the
app.

 I worked on the update all morning and finally got the functionality
done. The last step was to import the existing registration data from
the app into the new database. In the meantime, I thought it would be
nice to show the guy I know has a vested interest in seeing how the new
app works. I sent him a link to the app and said, basically, "Here's the
app. Give it a look. The last step is importing the existing data, which
is what I'm working on right now." Short, to the point, just an FYI.

 No problem, right?

 Riiiiight.

 This guy forwarded the email (intact) to his supervisor, who is pretty
high up in the company. The supervisor then forwarded *that* to
something like half the living population of the US. Finally, the
supervisor sent me - and copied all of these folks - a note that said,
basically, "Hey, that's great and all, but not all of the data's in
there. We need that data in there!"

 No shit, Sherlock. Did you *read* the email? That part where I said,
"I'm working on importing the data now" - that translates into "I'm
working on importing the data now." Just in case that wasn't clear.

 Gotta love people. Sort of leads me to believe that the higher ranking
you are, the less literate you become.
