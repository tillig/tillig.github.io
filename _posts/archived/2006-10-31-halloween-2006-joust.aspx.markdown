It's Halloween once again, and this year I went as a knight from the
1982 video game,
[*Joust*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joust_(arcade_game)).
 
 ![Joust! Complete with
ostrich!](https://hyqi8g.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y2phRVApgf3AsC0tObMJ4Zhr6iMB4BRZoD9aYPazoAOz4xjB3Qfmvy5AgGst0sriTjJN9dqfImQGYURM7ZhN4wqeYdl9bcHS_R4dvNtv2SfNZs/20061031joust.jpg?psid=1)
 
 I'm pretty stoked with this one, especially considering it came
together so quickly. I didn't have a chance to make anything this year
with the wedding and such, so I had to put my costume together from all
store-bought bits.
 
 Earlier in the month I had thought about being a *Joust* knight and
making the ostrich, but it was too much work for this year. Then when we
got back from the honeymoon, I hit Party City and *holy crap [they make
an inflatable ostrich
costume](http://www.gemmy.com/product.cfm?productId=24537&subCatId=144&parent=32)*.
Sold.
 
 Picked up the knight costume separately (also from Party City) and the
gauntlets and sword are from Target. (They don't sell lances, which is
understandable from a safety standpoint but does make things a bit less
authentic.) I think all told I did spend about \$80, but come on, it's
frickin' *Joust*.
 
 Won the "most original" award at the party I went to on Saturday and
got "coolest" costume at the contest at work today. I'd say that's a
success. I think I'm going to wear it while handing out candy to the
kids tonight. Of course, none of them will get it because the game is
from 1982, but maybe their parents will get a kick out of it.
 
 We had [155 trick-or-treaters last
year](/archive/2005/11/01/155-trick-or-treaters.aspx) so we bought more
candy this year. We'll see how many we get.
