I had planned a nice evening at home last night but instead got sucked
into going to Denny's to eat with Jenn and her [Job's
Daughters](http://www.iojd.org/) group. I can't say it was a complete
loss, though. I'm never one to scorn cheese fries.
 
 Plus, [Brittany, the Laura San Giacomo
look-alike](/archive/2003/04/07/dinner-at-walgreens.aspx), was there,
which was cool 'cuz she's hot. Not that anything's going on there, but
she's a good looking girl and that never hurts. So there's that.
 
 While we were sitting there I realized that all of my good party
stories are not family-appropriate. That is, I could tell them, but
they're sort of anti-climactic and unfunny if I don't throw a "shit" or
a "fuck" in there. Drew Carey's mentioned a similar issue regarding
jokes in [his
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078688939X/mhsvortex).
Which meant I was unnaturally quiet and way less entertaining than
normal. Maybe I should learn some clean jokes. (Except that they're
usually not funny.)
 
 Yesterday was Jenn's last day of working for free at the VA Hospital,
which means I got to sleep in until 6:15a this morning. That extra half
hour does make a difference, believe it or not.
 
 Oh, and I also got my copy of the [Buffy Season 4 DVD
set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008K2XP/mhsvortex) from
Amazon, but the case was sort of munched due to poor packaging and the
second disc was "floating" (not attached to the spindle in the case,
just sliding around), which resulted in some minor abrasions on the
surface. I [downloaded a utility](http://www.cdroller.com) to verify it
can still be read properly, and it seems to check out okay, so I guess
I'll call it good. I'm really not ready to watch six hours of TV just to
check.
 
 Looks like the [poop knife thing isn't
uncommon](/archive/2003/06/09/mysterious-silverware.aspx). That's messed
up. I wonder why people think that's necessary.
