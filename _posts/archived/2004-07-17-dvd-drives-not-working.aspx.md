I don't get on the computer at home too often. If I have to work from
home (or do some quick development), I usually fire up my work laptop
and do what needs to be done. I primarily use my home computer as a word
processor, data storage, and sometimes gaming machine.

 Fired up the ol' home PC today so I could watch some videos on this
CD-ROM I got bundled with [a toy I bought](http://www.astrojax.com/).
(The videos show different things the toy can do.)

 My DVD drives don't work. Neither of them. You put the CD in and it
registers that it's a CD in the drive but it thinks the disc is blank.

 Shit.

 I have since uninstalled any software I have that might do freaky stuff
to the drive - anything Roxio, iTunes, etc. - and that didn't fix it. My
next step is to run a repair on Windows.

 Of course, to run a repair on Windows you need a Windows CD, which my
computer didn't come with. Luckily I have an MSDN subscription through
work so I can get the ISO for a Windows disc... but I can't *burn the
damn thing because my drives aren't working*.

 Now I'm on the work laptop, getting the ISO so I can burn it, and then
I'll see if it's a Windows driver issue or a hardware issue (I'll try to
boot off the disc and see how it goes).

 You know what would be cool? If I wasn't the only one in my household -
let alone my family - who knew how to fix this stuff. It would be nice
to be able to rely on someone else to help me out rather than always
being the place where the buck stops.
