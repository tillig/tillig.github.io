Before I start this, let me say that I am not a coffee drinker. I
probably have one cup every two weeks or so, just because I need that
caffeine boost and the sugar in cola-flavored-beverages usually sort of
bogs me down.

 Today I need to do some serious programming, and the only thing that
makes me have a decent time with that is if I'm wide awake - enter the
caffeine.

 I went to get a cup of coffee this morning, and... the pot was empty. I
looked in, and it seemed that I was the first person to try to get
coffee because the pot was clean from the night before. Fine. I put
everything together and brewed a pot of coffee. When it was done, I got
a cup.

 I went back out an hour later and the fucking pot was empty again. God
forbid *anyone else* make a pot of coffee but *me, the
non-coffee-drinker*.

 I'm thinking I should rig the pots up with some sort of a scale and a
digital camera apparatus so that when the pot of coffee reaches a weight
approximating "empty," the camera will take a picture and send it to me
so I can bust the asshole that's not making coffee.

 Then again, not everyone knows how to make a pot of coffee. One time I
looked in the pot and [thought I was getting
tea](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pXuAE_noUKeHMD_mdTd5erHsuyPAPUvoniPXPJEKVvsMWNTU3ANggCntZy5W5MKWhsic2G4pOHvXAtqi553XCMr78oF379l2qEew4WULomc4/20021017weakcoffeeyc7.jpg?psid=1),
when it turns out [some people are just
idiots](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pSJRekSONVIcryLFvuq3sAkH3qTtcjNEc7A8sWLw_EPjp1Muuxs3GSdB-Y2c2z8ra3EvWYhTlunafq77nldZriFWJIdECI3MpXFRhwJr4_SY/20020418grindthebeanshl3.jpg?psid=1).
Yes, those pictures are real. Unbelieveable.

 This sort of reminds me of that movie [*City
Slickers*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000059TFL/mhsvortex)
when Billy Crystal's character, Mitch, is talking to Jack Palance's
character, Curly:

 *Mitch: Killed anyone today, Curly?*

 *Curly: Day ain't over yet.*
