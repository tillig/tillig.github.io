**Rock Star**

You scored 92%!

You damn rock star. You know all the basics, and if you got any wrong, I
bet it was that stupid Traveling Wilburys question. Your friends are
probably intimidated by your knowledge of classic rock and envy your
impressive collection. When a classic rock song comes on the radio, you
can probably identify it before the vocals kick in most of the time. You
probably get good scores on the "maiden name of Clapton's mom" tests,
too.
