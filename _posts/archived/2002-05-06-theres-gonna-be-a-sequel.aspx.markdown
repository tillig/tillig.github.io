[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 8]
 
 After talking to the rest of the guys in my department, of the folks
who have seen *[Spider-Man](http://www.spiderman.sonypictures.com/)*,
everyone agrees it was awesome. It looks like, according to
[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com), they're [making a
sequel](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0316654). That'd be cool. I hope it's
as good as this one.
 
 I'm also hoping that the new [Star Wars
movie](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0121765) holds its own. When they
released [Episode I](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120915), I was stoked,
but to be honest, except for the [Natalie
Portman](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Portman,+Natalie) action in there, it
wasn't *all that and a bag of chips*. Maybe it's the whole
"can't-live-up-to-the-hype" phenomenon I described in my [*Spider-Man*
review](/archive/2002/05/06/review-spider-man.aspx). Maybe it's the fact
that the Jar-Jar Binks character sucks *huge donkey*. Anyway, I hope
this latest installment justifies the hype.
 
 *[Alias](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/home/indexsd6.html)*
last night was *the bomb*. You never think it could possibly get more
intriguing or convoluted and then *it does*. It reminds me a bit of the
first few seasons of *[The X-Files](http://www.thex-files.com/)* or *[La
Femme Nikita](http://www.lafemmenikita.com/)*. I hope they can maintain
this breakneck pace. I'm loving it. I can't wait until they bring it out
on DVD. Besides... *[Jennifer
Garner](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Garner,+Jennifer)*. 'Nuff said on that
issue.
 
 Allergies: They suck. But I have medication now. Lots of it. I have
[Nasacort](http://www.nasacort.com/) for daily dosage, I have
[Allegra](http://www.allegra.com) to catch the stuff the Nasacort
doesn't, and for those "heavy days" I have
[Astelin](http://www.astelin.com/). Oh, and I got an [albuterol
inhaler](http://asthma.about.com/library/weekly/aa053199.htm) for when I
can't breathe, because, as it turns out, I guess I'm mildly asthmatic.
It just keeps getting better.
 
 I'm in the process right now of installing [Visual Studio
.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/). I've gotta figure out how to
write a Windows service, and it looks like .NET does a lot of that for
you. Here's hoping. Point being, I've been installing this thing for the
last *hour* and it's showing no signs of slowing. What a pain.
