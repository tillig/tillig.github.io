I have a two-in-one traffic asshole for you today.

 On Tuesday of last week, I was coming home and I noticed that my usual
exit to get home there was quite the backup. Turns out there was a car
parked *diagonally* across the right-hand lane of the two-lane exit.

 Normally I might feel bad for the guy whose car this was, since a
broken down car is not fun. But then I thought, "You know, a nice person
might have rolled the car around the corner into the *emergency lane* so
nobody would be blocked." That, coupled with the fact that the exit was
backed up for like a mile, made me much less sympathetic.

 Okay, so that was Tuesday. I took a picture in case nothing better (or
more frustrating) came along. But something did.

 Friday as I was coming home I noticed that my exit was backed up
*again!* What could it be this time?

 Oh, look, *there's a bus blocking the left lane*. Not even a full bus,
either - one of those retard busses that only show up if you schedule
them. ARGH! I ended up having to *pass* my exit, get off at the next
one, and then come back on side streets. The backup was so far back I
couldn't even get in line.

 Clogging up my exit has become quite the epidemic here. It's a good
thing I'm not armed.
