Before I get this going, a quick note: I saw both [*Minorty
Report*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181689) and [*The Sum of All
Fears*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0164184) yesterday, and both were quite
good. I'll have to work up a review for them when I get a chance.

 Now, on with the show.

 My commute this morning was like a gift that God Himself created
special for me, wrapped up in a little package, and handed to me in my
car. My normal commute takes about 45 minutes, give or take, in the
morning and close to 60 minutes returning home in the evening. My
commute to work this morning took *15 minutes*. Unbelieveable. I almost
cried.

 This brought to mind a theory I've been working on that I thought I
might share. Folks who know me have probably already heard this, but let
me enlighten those who haven't. I call it "The Theory of Indefinite
Commute." Let me explain.

 If I leave *really* early in the morning, I can get to work pretty
quickly (this happens on holidays, too, but we'll consider those
anomalies for the time being). The later I leave from my house, the
longer the commute takes. In fact, it increases at a nearly exponential
rate. Once a certain point in the morning is reached, the commute starts
taking less time because, of course, rush hour is ending. What happens
right in the middle of those two times? That's where the theory comes
in.

 **The Theory of Indefinite Commute**: There is a time in the morning
that, were I to leave and attempt to commute to work at that time, would
result in me commuting to work indefinitely.

 Here's a graph that illustrates the principle:

 The time I leave my apartment is represented by the X axis; the time it
takes me to get to work is represented by the Y axis. The blue lines
indicate how the commute normally functions. The red line is what the
theory revolves around. That's the point that, were I to leave at that
time, I would commute for time and all eternity.

 I'm not sure what, exactly, I've discovered. It may be a hole in the
time-space continuum that opens up at exactly that time, sort of like in
[*Time
Bandits*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305283699/mhsvortex).
Who knows? At times I wonder if I would simply commute until I died or
if I would actually commute eternally, immortal. Someday, maybe, I'll
attempt to locate exactly what time that is and try it... but I'm afraid
of what might happen. Maybe it's got something to do with the [Bermuda
Triangle](http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm). Maybe it's got
something to do with [how many licks it takes to get to the center of a
Tootsie Pop](http://www.tootsie-roll.com/memoriesLicks.html). I suppose,
as Mr. Owl says, "The world may never know."
