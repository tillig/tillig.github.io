![Redballs Red Wonka
Coat](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2p7Lx3mCbCcSZUeQIGBkWGYGBW1nkix2LZY2nn_YuP0g8KnQDTUUoRHviho71k5oDcChuMnysdL8GBq4ydITfM_hjZbln-sNKaF4BIOStVy2Y/20050829wonkacoat.jpg?psid=1)Just
got word from [Redballs](http://www.redballs.com) - they're going to
have more of the red Wonka jackets in mid-September. Perfect! I'll hang
on until then (which is closer to my budgetary timeline anyway) and get
the 2XL. That should save me hella time and money compared to making the
thing.

**UPDATE 10/02/05**: The costume came out well. [Here are the
details.](/archive/2005/10/02/wonka-costume-complete.aspx)
