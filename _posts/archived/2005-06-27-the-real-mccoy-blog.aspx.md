If you were ever a fan of the early-90's era techno band The Real McCoy,
[O-Jay (the rap artist from the band) has a blog
going](http://www.the-realmccoy.blogspot.com/) where he tells the story
of the rise and fall of the band.
 
 Actually it's interesting for fans and non-fans alike; a view into the
music industry from an insider's perspective.
