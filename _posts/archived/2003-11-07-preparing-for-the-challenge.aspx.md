Today's a hurry-up-and-wait sort of day. I'm supposed to get my product
demo all compiled up and burned onto CDs for everyone, but I have one
piece that I'm waiting to get from another guy and he's having Visual
SourceSafe problems, so I don't think I'm going to make my 11:30a
deadline.

 Oh, just got another email. I guess it's back up. Maybe I'll make it
after all.

 In the meantime, I've got everything set to go, ready to burn the CDs
and distribute this thing once all the pieces are in place. A nice close
to a good project. At least I'm not running around frantically trying to
get things to work.

 At 12:30p I'll be heading down to the semi-yearly coding "competition"
they refer to as "Boot Camp" around here. Each time they have a
different problem to solve and you get assigned to a team and your team
has to come up with a program that solves it. Previous problems have
included creating an online auction system and solving a business
problem of your choice (your app had to be the "most used" at the end of
two weeks to be the winner). This year it's the "Puzzle Challenge" where
we have to write an app that will solve... a puzzle of some nature. It's
a surprise, so I don't know what it is yet. We'll have eight hours to
solve whatever it is. Should be fun.

 Plus, you can win prizes for good coding. I plan on winning.

 So I'm waiting. Waiting for the other guy to finish his part of the
demo project. Waiting for 12:30 to roll around so I can go kick some
coding ass. Generally waiting.

 I think that's hella better than scrambling around madly, don't you?
