The [new Kelly Clarkson
single](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006JT6D/mhsvortex) is
out: *Before Your Love* and *A Moment Like This*, the songs she sang on
the last [*American Idol*](http://idolonfox.msn.com) show. I'm not a big
fan of the songs, but I love Kelly, so I picked one up. Besides, Jenn
would've killed me if I didn't. I got it fresh out of the shipment box
first thing this morning at [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com).

 Now I'm waiting for the techno dance remixes. I guarantee they'll be
better than the originals. :)
