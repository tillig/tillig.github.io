The [eigth
Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=9), re:
developer tools (one of the best shows so far, IMHO), gives a bit of a
shout out to
[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
- my DXCore plugin to allow preview of XML doc comments from within
Visual Studio. Woohoo!

 If you like CR_Documentor, [check out my other stuff](/), too. Got a
few other DXCore plugins you might find handy.
