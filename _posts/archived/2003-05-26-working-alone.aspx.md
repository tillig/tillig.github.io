There's nobody else in my department today, and hardly anyone in the
entire building.

 Let me tell you how cool that is.

 I don't have anyone randomly stopping by to chat or interrupt me, I
don't have people in my way when I go get something to drink, and I can
make a pot of coffee and I will be guaranteed to get a cup.

 Plus, except for the white noise of the fans on the servers in my cube,
the place is totally *quiet*. I don't have to crank up my music to hear
it, the phones aren't ringing... and ringing... and ringing...

 This is *the life*, I tell you.
