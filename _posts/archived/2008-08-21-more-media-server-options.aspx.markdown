I still haven't solved my media server problem, mostly because I know
it's going to be a time-suck to set it all up and rip all the DVDs and
get it to meet the minimum Wife Acceptance Factor. I can imagine eating
up a full weekend on it. It'll be nice when it's done - if it gets done
- but the investment is sort of a hurdle.

Anyway, following various Twitter links and surfing around, I've found a
couple more interesting articles to contribute to the thought pool.

-   [**How to choose a DLNA Media Server for Windows, Mac OS X, or
    Linux**](http://www.rbgrn.net/blog/2007/08/how-to-choose-dlna-media-server-software-in-windows-mac-os-x-or-linux.html):
    This points out a few software alternatives to Windows Media Center.
-   [**The Death of
    DVD**](http://angryhacker.com/blog/archive/2007/08/20/the-death-of-dvd.aspx):
    A story about switching from using DVDs to using a Mac Mini running
    Boot Camp and Windows Media Center/[My
    Movies](http://www.mymovies.dk/) as a home theater PC, Windows Home
    Server as the storage.

That "death of DVD" article comes closest to what I'm looking for. It
even points to Windows Home Server for storage, which is definitely
something I'm considering. The only real problem is the number of PCs
and the form factor of each that I currently have. I have a desktop
and a really under-powered mini-tower that I can use for the HTPC and
the file server. The problem is that neither are really suited to sit in
my living room. The desktop is too large, and the mini-tower, which is a
better size, isn't nearly powerful enough to be anything but a
simple file server. Of course, it's not powerful enough to run Windows
Home Server, either, so if I wanted to go that route, I'd have to
allocate the desktop to it and punt entirely on that mini tower.

And there's the rub.

So now the current plan is (I think), based on budget and time...

1.  Get a 1TB drive from Costco that I can use to start the ripping of
    the movies.
2.  Get the mini-tower formatted with some sort of OS on it that can
    work as a file server. Maybe a Linux variant with Samba or
    something. Jury's out.
3.  Hook up the 1TB drive to the file server.
4.  Hook up my existing media/archive drive to that, too. (I have iTunes
    on my laptop running off of that so I can just switch where the
    network drive gets mapped to and I'm good.)
5.  Rip a couple of movies so I can test it out.
6.  Get Vista Ultimate (I have a license for it just hanging out) on the
    desktop and get My Movies installed.
7.  Point the desktop to the file share on the mini-tower with the
    movies and see if the media server will play it reasonably.
8.  Start making decisions:
    -   Does the mini tower work reasonably as a file share? Is it fast
        enough?
    -   Can the desktop go out in the living room or is it too big and
        loud? If it's too big and loud...
        -   Should it be the file server instead so there's some more
            power behind it?
        -   Do I need a Mac Mini or the like for the living room?

    -   When do I get my 1080p TV? (I have 720p now.) Do I want the TV
        more than the media center? (Probably.)

What my ultimate plan would be to save me time and frustration...

1.  [Get a 1TB Windows Home
    Server](http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11273362&search=mediasmart&Mo=1&cm_re=1_en-_-Top_Left_Nav-_-Top_search&lang=en-US&Nr=P_CatalogName:BC&Sp=S&N=5000043&whse=BC&Dx=mode+matchallpartial&Ntk=Text_Search&Dr=P_CatalogName:BC&Ne=4000000&D=mediasmart&Ntt=mediasmart&No=1&Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&Nty=1&topnav=&s=1)
    (\$730).
2.  [Get a Mac
    Mini](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/mac_mini)
    (\$600).
3.  [Get a Media Center remote control and
    receiver](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=065)
    for the Mac Mini (\$30).
4.  Install my copy of Vista Ultimate on the Mac Mini using Boot Camp.
5.  Install My Movies on the Mac Mini.
6.  Rip DVDs to the Windows Home Server.
7.  Play through Mac Mini/Vista/My Movies.

That sounds simple and doesn't require any stressful decision making...
but it does run \$1360 (plus, in some cases, shipping). Is it worth the
extra cost for reduced hassle? (It might be.)

**UPDATE 8/25/08:** I ended up [getting a Windows Home
Server](/archive/2008/08/25/windows-home-server-first-impressions.aspx).
