[![Trans-Siberian
Orchestra]({{ site.url }}/images/20071203transsiberian.jpg)](http://www.trans-siberian.com)Yesterday
we went to the Rose Garden to see [Trans-Siberian
Orchestra](http://www.trans-siberian.com) in their 2007 tour.

Wow.

I mean, I've seen my share of concerts, but these guys really do it up
right.  Lights.  Set pieces.  Fire.  Lasers.  Freaking *snow*.  Oh,
yeah.

Best known for their rock and roll arrangements of classic Christmas
music (you've most likely heard ["Christmas Eve/Sarajevo
12/24"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002JX6?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000002JX6)),
TSO puts on a really awesome two-part show.

The first part of the show is their Christmas fare.  They use their
music to tell the story of an angel crossing the world looking for
something that represents Christmas.  Some of the music is the
well-known stuff you've heard on the radio and some of it is original
music and lyrics.  I won't lie; I'm not as into the original stuff as I
am with the updated arrangements on old standards, but it's all really
well done and the story is told very well.

The second part of the show is what they refer to as "play time."  They
break away from Christmas music and play other pieces, mainly rock and
roll arrangements of other classical tunes.

Let me tell you something:  You have never heard "O Fortuna" or
Beethoven's Fifth until you've heard them [done by Trans-Siberian
Orchestra](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S7LI?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00004S7LI). 
The standard arrangements are, of course, classics, but the TSO versions
are *invigorating*.  Life gets brought back to these pieces in a way
it's hard to describe.

What really made the show is that you could tell every one of the
performers lives to do this.  They looked like they were having the time
of their lives up there on stage, making music, having fun.  You
wouldn't imagine you could rock a violin, but [Anna Phoebe, their
violinist, does it](http://www.annaphoebe.com/).  Duelling electric
guitarists show each other up on stage, the loser slumping his shoulders
and pouting his way off stage.  A medley of fast-and-furious piano solos
ends up with Vince Guaraldi's "Linus and Lucy."  Heads bang, hair is
flipped, musicians charge through the audience.  The energy is high and
every single one of the performers is almost literally glowing with the
fun they're having.

It's a hell of a show.

If you get a chance to check them out, definitely do.  The music on CD
is good, but it's nothing compared to the live production.  I'll be
there again next year, no question about it.
