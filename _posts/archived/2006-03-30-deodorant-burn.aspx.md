Something I forgot to mention about my trip: While I was in the bathroom
at the hotel yesterday morning getting ready, I pulled the cap off my
deodorant and the entire deodorant stick, including the little
turny-thing that pushes the stick out of the plastic case, flew out of
the case and onto the bathroom floor.

 That rocked. It took me a minute to decide whether I should go without
or pick it up and attempt to use it.

 I ended up using it.

 But I sent Jenn an SMS message to pick me up some more deodorant at the
store so I wouldn't be screwed today.

 She went to the store and they didn't have my kind (again) so she
picked up this Speed Stick Gel that she liked the smell of. I discovered
a while ago that [I am allergic to Speed Stick
Gel](/archive/2005/11/28/thanksgiving-2005.aspx), but this was a
different scent, so I gave it a shot.

 My armpits are *on fucking fire*.

 I'm going to have to go wash them out and pick something new up at the
store tonight. Burning armpits is funny, but it kind of sucks, too.
