I just finished my MS 070-300 test, *Analyzing Requirements And Defining
Microsoft .NET Solution Architectures*, and I ***PASSED***. That means
I'm now a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer in .NET. According to
[*MCP Magazine*](http://www.mcpmag.com/), as of November 6, 2003, there
are only 4,711 people in the world with that certification, so it still
might hold a little weight.

 Regardless, I passed what I figured to be probably the hardest of the
tests in the MCSD.NET series. It was case studies with questions over
each case study rather than a simple set of questions (which is what all
my others were). I don't like the case studies because they sort of
imply certain "right" and "wrong" answers that may or may not be quite
what you do in real life. They're very... subjective. In other tests, it
was much more clear which answers were "right" and "wrong." If the
answers were skewed a certain way, it was kind of obvious from the
question which way they would want you to skew them. Not so in this
latest test, and I think that was the tough part.

 I suppose it's moot now. ***I PASSED!***
