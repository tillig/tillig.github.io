I have one of those apple slicing/coring devices at work. I hate eating
apples whole, but love apple slices (odd? maybe).

 I just went and sliced an apple and *utterly destroyed* this thing. The
blades all bent and started coming apart...

 Maybe I should purchase a higher quality of kitchen gadget. In the
meantime, what am I going to do with all these apples?
