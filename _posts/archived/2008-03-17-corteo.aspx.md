[![Corteo
[Soundtrack]](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CCK0NM72L._AA240_.jpg)](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5XDUQ?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000I5XDUQ)On>
Friday, Jenn and I went to see the new traveling [Cirque du
Soleil](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com) show,
*[Corteo](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/intro/intro.htm)*.

***Wow.***

I've seen several of the Cirque shows:

- *[Mystère](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/mystere/mystere-Las-Vegas.htm)*
    (twice)
- [*KÀ*](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/ka/home/intro.htm)
    (twice)
- [*Alegría*](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/alegria/intro/intro.htm)
- *[Dralion](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/dralion/intro/intro.htm)*
- [*Saltimbanco*](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/saltimbanco/intro/intro.htm)
- *[Varekai](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/varekai/intro/intro.htm)*

Each show has its own feel and I have liked all of them. *Mystère* holds
a special place in my heart for being the first Cirque show I ever saw.
*KÀ* struck me with its size and story. *Dralion* had a very original
style. All of that given, across shows you will generally see some acts
reused. The
[hand-to-hand](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/Mystere/Mystere-acts1.htm),
amazing as it is, shows up a couple of times. The [aerial
straps](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/varekai/acts/aerial_straps.htm),
beautiful to watch, also show up in a few places. Not so in *Corteo*.

*Corteo* felt so fresh, so new, that I couldn't help but leave the show
feeling *happy and invigorated*. Everything was so amazing, so crazy, so
cool, I'd have to say ***Corteo* is my favorite of all the shows I've
seen**. It was easily worth the price of admission and I'd see it again
in a heartbeat.

I had never seen any of [the
acts](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/acts/acrobatic.htm)
before (with the exception of the [aerial
straps](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/acts/straps.htm),
which still felt very new) and it included one of my favorite acts,
"[Crystal Glasses and Tibetan
Bowls](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/acts/glasses.htm),"
a sampling of which you can catch on the Cirque TV show,
*[Solstrom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SMGTI?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007SMGTI)*.
I liked them all, but if I had to choose, I think I liked the
[chandeliers](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/acts/chandeliers.htm)
and the [helium
dance](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/acts/helium.htm)
the best.

If *Corteo* comes to your city, ***go***, and feel alive again.
