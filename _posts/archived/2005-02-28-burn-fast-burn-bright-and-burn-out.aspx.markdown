I'm not sure how it started. I can only assume it was while cruising
iTunes, but I've gotten into this mid-90's Britpop groove. More
specifically, I went on a mission questing for early
[Oasis](http://www.oasisinet.com/) albums.
 
 I picked up [*(What's The Story) Morning
Glory*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002BBY/mhsvortex) and
[*Definitely
Maybe*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002AS3/mhsvortex).
After a few runs through "Champagne Supernova" and "Live Forever," I'm
starting to feel the romanticism of the burn fast, burn bright, burn out
rockstar lifestyle. The "alone in a crowd" feeling of being high and low
at the same time. I had a similar feeling after watching [*Almost
Famous*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXMG/mhsvortex) -
a ship of emotion on a rolling sea of fame.
 
 Visions of drugged-out rock stars sitting in an expensive high-rise
hotel room, throwing the TV through the plate glass door to the balcony
and abusing the heroin-junkie groupies, the only people left who care.
Fashion, glitz, and glamour, taken intravenously, destroying the user
from the inside out.
 
 I don't yearn to be a part of that, but I do appreciate the romantic,
self-destructive quality of it. It intrigues me. I'm fascinated by the
people who choose to surf those waves, to ride until they crash, and
sometimes even get back onboard and try the ride again. A glimpse into
that life is enough, and then it's time to return to reality.
