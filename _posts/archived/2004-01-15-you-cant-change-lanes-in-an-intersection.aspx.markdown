I tried to get a picture of this asswipe, but it was too dark out.
 
 I think I was just about killed today on my way in to work. Everything
was going *swimmingly* when I pulled up to the stoplight at [SW 4th and
Caruthers](http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?location=4mwX30mRV%2fsZ0Arh%2fZMiaNCM4QsVQ43KYHFwVB1BHCymyJV9qROZLo3OJ5jOV89d7oLiScFPCaVxe8%2fuk%2fOVySyAbbOnYeI2h%2bOK60xtkVFHKXsYspjojQHphjkxYQivUIbIUWp1yHE%3d&address=4th%20and%20Caruthers&city=Portland&state=OR&zipcode=&country=US&addtohistory=&submit=Get%20Map).
I was the third car in line. When the light turned green I started
moving through the intersection, and when I was just about through it,
this *asshole in a silver Volkswagen cuts right in front of me*, not
only changing lanes in an intersection without signaling, but trying to
fit a full car in a half car's length. I slammed on the brakes and the
horn, swerving to avoid getting my front passenger fender taken clean
off and the guy (I assume it was a guy, but I couldn't see) continued
without even noticing. He (she/it/whatever) came close to running me
head-on into a concrete dividing wall.
 
 Like I said, after recovering from this feat of ridiculousness, I
caught up with the car but wasn't able to get a picture because it was
too dark. His/her license plate was ZPR 448, though. Normally I wouldn't
post something like that, but when you're as reckless as that, you
deserve it.
 
 Sometimes I wish I was an undercover cop so I could pull these assholes
over. I mean, seriously, folks, if you can't think ahead enough to know
you need to be in a particular lane, at least wait until someone lets
you in. Accept the consequences of your stupidity if no one does and
*get on somewhere else*. Next time, maybe you'll remember to get in line
like everyone else.
