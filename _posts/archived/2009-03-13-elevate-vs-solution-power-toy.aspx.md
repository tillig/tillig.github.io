I found that being able to right-click a .sln file and open it as
Administrator in Visual Studio is a huge help because I always open
solutions by finding the solution file and opening from there, not
opening Visual Studio first. Anyway, based on the [Elevation Power
Toys](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.06.elevation.aspx)
stuff, I write an "Elevate VS Solution" Power Toy that lets you
right-click a .sln file and open it as Administrator.

Download the zip file, extract the .inf file, right-click, install.
Standard disclaimers ("works on my box!") apply.
