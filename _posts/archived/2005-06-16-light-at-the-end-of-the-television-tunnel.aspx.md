I achieved a semblance of closure on this whole television issue
yesterday when I spoke with the manager of the Beaverton [Magnolia
A/V](http://www.magnoliahifi.com/) store (whose name is Dick) and he
said he'd give me trade-in credit of half the purchase price of my
distort-o-vision toward the purchase of a new TV.

 Woohoo!

 I'm going to go in on Saturday and pick out a new set. They'll pick up
the old one, fix it up, and sell it as a used/refurb. That takes care of
all my problems: I don't have to figure out how to get the behemoth out
of my living room, and I don't have to eat the whole cost of a new set.

 I'm looking at direct-view LCD TVs (not rear-projection). The Magnolia
service rep recommended the [Sharp
Aquos](http://www.sharpusa.com/products/AQUOS/) line of TVs, and that's
pretty much where I ended up with my research, too. I've seen some other
brands out there that look okay, but everywhere I turn, someone tells me
to consider the Sharp.

 The 37" models are sort of in my price range (with my trade-in credit
and some price negotiations), so I think that's where I'll go. I'd like
the 45" model, but that's a bit pricey for me.

 Saturday, here I come!
