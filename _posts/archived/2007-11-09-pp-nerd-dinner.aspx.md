Went to [Hanselman's Nerd
Dinner](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/November8thSeattleRedmondBellevueNerdDinner.aspx)
last night and must say, it was well worth it.  A lot of folks turned
out for it, including [Omar Shahine](http://www.shahine.com/omar/),
[Adam Kinney](http://adamkinney.com/), [John
Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/), [Jason Haley](http://jasonhaley.com/)...
oh, yeah, and [Lutz Roeder](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/).  A great
social event and a [piroshky](http://www.piroshkybakery.com/)?  *Hellz*
yeah.

Oh, I bugged Lutz about it again, and **he's letting me
release**[**CR_Documentor**](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)**as
open source**.  Apparently there was some political hoopla going on
before that would have been bad had I released it, but that seems to
have passed so it's cool now.  All you folks wanting new features and
wondering why I've been stagnating - now you can contribute.  I'm going
to finish up my refactor of it so it's stable and get it out there.
This definitely gives me a renewed interest in finishing up the next
release.  Yay!
