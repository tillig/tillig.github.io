I forgot to mention earlier that I was able to successfully spend
several hours on the wireless network at home last night without any
connection issues. I think the hard reset on the router fixed my
problems.

 I enabled Remote Desktop on the machine in the computer room and was
able to connect to it from my laptop in the living room and work on my
iTunes music library while watching TV. I can't begin to tell you how
cool that is. (I know, all you other wireless people are laughing and
saying things like "Welcome to the 21st century!" but, in my defense, I
use this stuff all the time at work, I just never got into it at home.
Now that I've got it, I'm liking it. Next stop, tablet PC?)
