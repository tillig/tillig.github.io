We put the [fake] Christmas tree up yesterday and decorated the house a
bit.  It sort of got that nice, cozy holiday feel to it.

Both of the cats started promptly chewing on the limbs they could reach,
in many cases actually swallowing the nylon needles they were able to
extract.  While my cat seems more interested in the act of chewing than
the actual extraction of needles, Jenn's little wild man seems hell bent
on a combination of destruction and consumption.

Woke up this morning and found about eight cat puke spots in various
places throughout the house.  Most had nylon tree needles, I'm sure from
both cats getting their fill.  Awesome.

To top it off, Jenn's cat decided that it was time, finally, to pee on
[the new couch we just bought at
Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/11086/).  We
know without a doubt it was Jenn's cat this time because there is no way
my female cat could have peed *all the way up the arm* of the couch
quite like that.  We had thought that he was just doing that to
furniture that didn't smell like him or something, but it seems to be...
well, fairly arbitrary.  Again, awesome.

So things are pretty well coming together for a great holiday season. 
Granted, [the Trans-Siberian Orchestra
concert](/archive/2007/12/03/trans-siberian-orchestra-2007-tour.aspx)
was a big plus to the start of the season, but now that the good stuff's
out of the way, we're getting settled in for a good old-fashioned
Griswold family Christmas.  Where's the Tylenol?
