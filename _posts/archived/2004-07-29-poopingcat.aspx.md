I'm working at home today while the drywall contractors are here fixing
my bathroom and my Tiny Cat is loving every minute of it. You'd think
that all the sanding and vacuuming and noise would freak her out, but
when she's not sitting next to me on the couch trying to lay in the
middle of the laptop keyboard, she's over there poking around to see
what sort of trouble she can get into.
 
 Tiny Cat is weird. We kept her in the bathroom when she was very small
(to get her used to the house, learn how to use the litter box, etc.)
and now she has this connection with the bathroom that I can't explain.
She loves to be in there while you're taking a dump. Loves it. She'll
cry and paw at the door if you don't let her in. Once she's in, she'll
walk around the base of the toilet and flop on her back expecting to be
petted.
 
 Of course, now the humans in the house expect her to be there, so if
you're going to the bathroom and she doesn't show up, you leave the door
open and yell "POOPINGCAT!" (long, like a yodel:
"Poooooooopingcaaaaaaaaat!") and she'll come running. Seriously - you
won't have to wait more than a couple seconds. In fact, if you're in a
different room than her and yell "Poopingcat," she'll head to the
closest bathroom to you because, well, that's where the Poopingcat
goes.
 
 What a silly cat.
