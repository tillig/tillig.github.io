[Eli Lopian from TypeMock has
blogged](http://www.elilopian.com/2007/05/16/typemock-case-study-in-corillian/)
the case study we did with TypeMock showing how much more productive we
are in testing using [TypeMock](http://www.typemock.com).

 We've been vastly more productive using TypeMock than we were before we
adopted it. If you get a chance, check out the [Case Study
PDF](http://www.typemock.com/files/TypeMock_Corillian_CaseStudy.pdf). It
pretty much says it all. And if you haven't tried TypeMock yet, what are
you waiting for? [Go get it.](http://www.typemock.com/Downloads.php)
You'll like it, I promise.

 (In the interest of ~~shameless-self-promotion~~ full disclosure, I'm
fairly prominently quoted in the case study. I can't lie; it makes me
smile. Can't help but love TypeMock.)
