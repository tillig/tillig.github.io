Had a bit of a PS3 weekend this weekend. Realized I had the PS3 but
really hadn't played any games on it, using it primarily as a Blu-ray
player, so thought it might be time to see how it went.

The first game I picked up was
*[Echochrome](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/echochrome)*. It's
sort of like "MC Escher: The Game." The idea is that you've got this
little mannequin that walks around on a sort of wireframe-looking level
that obeys certain "laws of perspective" like "perspective existence" -
if you can't see an obstacle, it doesn't exist. It's sort of hard to
explain - watch the video.

What I like about it is that it makes you think in a different way. A
level that looks impossible to traverse is actually pretty simple if you
think in perspective. It's definitely worth the $10 I paid for it.

IV]({{ site.url }}/images/20080804scvader.jpg)The
second game I got was *[Soul Calibur
IV](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZK7ZMQ?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ZK7ZMQ)*.
I debated whether I should get this on Xbox 360, where the "special
character" included is Yoda, but decided that the PS3's special
character, Darth Vader, would just be cooler to fight with. Yoda's neat
and all, but I don't really think "bad ass" when I see Yoda. It's
more... novelty value. Darth Vader, though, I'm thinkin' that boy's
gonna put the beat down on someone.

Jenn and I put a few rounds in here and, while I was pretty decent at
*[Soul Calibur
III](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000935256?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000935256)*,
Jenn kicked my ass like nine out of ten rounds just by button mashing.
(She's really good at button mashing.) I'll have to bust out the guide
and practice up again. It's been a couple of years since I played *SC3*
so I've gotta get back in the groove. Still, tons of fun, and totally
great graphics and sound. A total step up from *SC3* and a good way to
get myself into the PS3 game world.

One thing Jenn and I noticed while playing *SC4*: On PS3, when you turn
it on, you can "sign in" to the Playstation Network with an account you
create, which then associates purchases, etc., with your "profile." This
seems very similar to the Xbox Live account sort of thing, where you
sign in and then play games and achievements get associated with your
profile. On Xbox, though, when you play two people at the same time,
both of you are signed in - I get signed in on my control, Jenn gets
signed in on hers, and when we play, each of us can unlock
achievements.Â  PS3 doesn't have achievements (there's a notion of
"trophies" that's still pretty new) and it turns out you can't sign
multiple people in at the same time, so we ended up playing with only me
signed in even though Jenn has her own account. We both thought that was
sort of weird. Hopefully they'll fix that in the future.
