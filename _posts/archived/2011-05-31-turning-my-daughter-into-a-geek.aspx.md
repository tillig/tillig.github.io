I've been not-so-subtly influencing my six-month-old daughter in a
geek-oriented direction. I already mentioned [the Bigtrak Jr. I have
waiting](/archive/2011/05/18/bigtrak-awesome-toy-for-subversive-programming-education.aspx)
for her, but I've also sprung for some clothing items of choice:

[![Made With Love (and Science)
Creeper](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/frontsquare/e74b_love_science.jpg)](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Ftshirts-apparel%2Fkids%2Fe74b%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=0E74BTUR6M)

[![Superhero
Snapsuits](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/frontsquare/e6b6_superhero_snapsuit_main.jpg)](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Ftshirts-apparel%2Fkids%2Fe6b6%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=0E6B6BLK6M)

(I only bought [the Wonder Woman superhero
onesie](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Ftshirts-apparel%2Fkids%2Fe6b6%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=0E6B6BLK6M),
but the others may be appropriate at some point.)

She's not quite ready for blocks, but soon I'll probably look at one of
these two sets - [Mad Scientist
blocks](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fgeek-kids%2F1-3-years%2Fb78f%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=KB78F)
or [Periodic Table
blocks](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fgeek-kids%2F1-3-years%2Fe5f7%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=KE5F7).
I'm not sure which.

[![Young Mad Scientist Alphabet
Blocks](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/frontsquare/b78f_mad_scientist_blocks2.jpg)](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fgeek-kids%2F1-3-years%2Fb78f%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=KB78F)

[![Periodic Table Building
Blocks](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/frontsquare/e5f7_periodic_table_building_blocks.jpg)](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fgeek-kids%2F1-3-years%2Fe5f7%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=KE5F7)

Fun stuff.

I was also thinking last night that it's really too bad that they don't
have Fisher Price video game controllers the way they have [toy cell
phones.](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-4317610-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fgeek-kids%2F1-3-years%2Fe422%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=KE422)
My daughter always wants to grab the controller while we're playing and
it'd be nice to just give her a controller of her own.
