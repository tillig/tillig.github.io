I like a [good customer service
experience](/archive/2003/07/03/real-customer-service.aspx). I don't
normally ask for assistance from customer service at a company - I'm a
big fan of self-service - but when I do need help, it's not like I'm
making up some imaginary need.
 
 I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue where a user on our intranet gets
prompted to log in when they visit the intranet home page. Internet
Explorer should automatically log them in, but it's not doing it. I
found that they have some [Segue Software](http://www.segue.com)
products installed, so thought I'd search the knowledge base over there
to see if there are any known issues.
 
 First, they make you register to read the knowledge base. Normally I
don't have a problem with this, but they do it in a sneaky way: They
show you a form where you enter your email address, desired username,
and desired password, then you click a register button... just so you
can fill out a *second, longer form* with more personal information.
Fill that out, click the register button *again*, and you get told that
they have to "confirm" your account, so you can't access the site until
you get an email from them with a confirmation link.
 
 That wouldn't be too bad if the email showed up quickly, but it takes
half an hour to get to you. Once you click the registration link, it
validates your account, but you *still have to log in*.
 
 So you log in, go to the knowledge base, and enter your search terms.
Clicking search gets you nowhere, though, because you have to select a
product name to search articles about that product. Here's what you see
for the list of products:
 ![Where's the
beef?](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pEFB4R0NnAwyQPSGvBuZqMEDIjQlurBRIX_ssaZtX1Yo-DFIqyvvCGWDyktid8BNGtRHN3mfPDW4iHQ_Epf7LeO_S3ji0vCeK_TcjZiwzrlc/20040611selectproduct.gif?psid=1)
 
 At this point, I'm pretty irate. I decide to contact the support people
directly to tell them there's a problem with their knowledge base and it
needs to be rectified:
> Hello!
>  
>  I'm trying to search your knowledge base but it tells me to "select a

> dropdown box with any product names, so I CAN'T.
>  
>  Please either fix the selection box or remove the requirement that I
> select a product.
>  
>  Thanks,
>  -T


 
 Pretty reasonable request, right? Here's what I get back:

 What? You want my customer ID and all that because *your site* is
broken? I don't want you to open a call, I just want your fucking site
to work so I can do my job. I've been fighting this thing for a while
now, and I'm fresh out of patience.

 I figured it was over at that point. One of the QA guys logged me in
and, wonder of wonders, the product selection box populates, things seem
to magically work. But their tech folks aren't letting up.

 Since when has the knowledge base been a "secure area?" An even better
question: How come I can get to the "secure area" but have some broken
form so it looks like a technical malfunction in the site as opposed to
a conscious decision to deny access? God damn, these people stepped on
my last nerve.

 And that's where it stands. Here's a message to all those companies out
there who require people jump through ridiculous hoops to get
self-service support from your web site: ***You're turning away
potential and, in many cases, existing customers.***
