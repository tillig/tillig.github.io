[Typemock](http://www.typemock.com/) released a new tool you can use to
identify potential deadlock conditions via unit tests called [Typemock
Racer](http://www.typemock.com/learn_about_typemock_racer.php). If
you've [wondered how to test thread
safety](/archive/2007/08/30/how-do-you-test-thread-safety.aspx) and
such, this is for you.

Plus, with the release, **they're giving away free licenses**. Try Racer
out, blog about the experience, and tell Typemock about it, and you'll
get a license for Racer. The full details are [over on the Typemock
blog](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/06/easy-deadlock-detection-get-free.html).
