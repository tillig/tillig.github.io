This is the first entry I've actually personally made in pMachine. I've
finally gotten around to updating the templates on everything, and while
there are several color-related CSS things I need to finish, I think
I've got things pretty well taken care of. Now I just have to figure out
how to import my stuff from Greymatter, and I'll be good to go.
