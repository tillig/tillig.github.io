I thought of the greatest idea just now while I was taking a leak.

 So, you know how your standard Venetian blinds have all these little
blades that rotate in order to close and open the blinds, right? You can
twist the little stick to make it so you can see out (or not).

 Well, they make blinds in different colors, right?

 And I have seen "rainbow" blinds with different colors of "blades" in a
rainbow pattern...

 So how come you can't buy blinds that have pictures painted/printed on
the blades? So like, if I close my blinds, I could see a tropical
forest, or a beach, or even just a sunny day in the city?

 I think that's actually a marketable thing. You could have any number
of things printed on the blinds. Classic artwork, scenery, family photos
(if you're that into the family thing), etc. The possibilities are
endless. You could even take pictures people submit and print up blinds
based on their photos, if you really wanted to get into it. You could
also make it so that when you close the blinds, you see a picture on
BOTH SIDES. That might be cool, too.

 Does that already exist? If not, maybe I just found my way to retire...
