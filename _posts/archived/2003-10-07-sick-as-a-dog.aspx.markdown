I woke up this morning at 2:00a and couldn't go back to sleep, so after
laying in bed for two hours staring at the ceiling I decided to get up.
 
 I sat in the living room, reading various periodicals that have been
piling up for months, finally getting to the Hollywood gossip folks
crave. My tiny cat helped me read by burying her face in my neck under
my chin and slobbering while she kneaded (no claws = safe). She does
that every once in a while and I'm not sure why, but it's damn funny.
 
 Jenn got up at her usual 6:00a and came out to tell me it was time to
get ready for work. I hopped in the shower, cranked up the heat, and
stood there, unmoving, for probably 20 minutes. There's something about
a hot shower when you're sick.
 
 Eventually I got my clothes on, grabbed my bag, and headed out the
door. On the way to work I stopped at the store to get some DayQuil,
decongestants, and Pepto-Bismol. It was a hard drive because I was
tired, but I took a 15 minute snooze in the store's parking lot and felt
at least a little better.
 
 And now I'm at work, working on the product demo project that I've been
assigned to. I took some time yesterday and this morning to do a bit of
an overhaul on it because I was developing quickly and not providing a
very good back-end design. I've now entirely separated the business
logic from the UI so maybe sometime they'll be able to reuse my UI in a
more robust demo.
 
 My throat is dry, my sinuses are clogged, I'm tired and achy. Yeah, I'm
sick. It really sucks, too, because I was supposed to get my allergy
shot today but you can't go in when you're sick, so maybe Friday.
 
 I have a 3:00p - 4:00p meeting today... I think I'm going home right
after that.
