I'm going to start right off and be the overly insensitive asshole that
I probably am.

 I am *beyond tired* of hearing about the September 11th attacks.

 This in *no way* implies that I don't respect the efforts of the people
involved with the rescue and cleanup, that I don't feel bad for the
losses that occurred, or that I don't understand the impact or the
magnitude of the event. What it implies is that I'm the kind of person
who would rather continue on with life and fight for improvement than
continually regress and mourn.

 The media today is *eating this up*. The radio's talking about it, the
TV's talking about it, it's in the newspapers, on web sites...

 Have you ever said a word so many times, over and over, that eventually
the word sounds funny to you and you almost forget what it means?
*That's September 11 to me.* It's lost all meaning in the larger context
because I've been so *bombarded* with it, so beaten with it, that I
really just don't give a rat's ass anymore.

 So, I'm pissed off. I'm pissed off that no matter where I go, I can't
escape it. And just as folks should definitely have the right to mourn
their losses, *I* should have the same right *not to have to listen to
the whining*.

 All right, I'm done. For now.

 Went to see [*Stealing Harvard*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0265808) last
night on sneak preview. Eh. It was pretty funny. I laughed in parts.
It's not as funny as I'd hoped it would be, but it was good. [Jason
Lee](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Lee,+Jason+(I)) totally carried the movie -
[Tom Green](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Green,+Tom+(III)) was sort of funny
but ended up just coming off as irritating in many parts. [Leslie
Mann](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Mann,+Leslie) is hot, so that was an
upside, and, of course, [Megan
Mullally](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Mullally,+Megan) is always
entertaining (and hot, even when she plays white trash). In the end,
though, I was glad to have gone to see it for free. It's a rental at
best in my book.

 And another band I'm curious to know what happened to: [Pop Will Eat
Itself](http://ubl.artistdirect.com/music/artist/card/0,,480467,00.html?src=redirsearch&artist=Pop+Will+Eat+Itself).
Loved these guys before, still love 'em. What happened?
