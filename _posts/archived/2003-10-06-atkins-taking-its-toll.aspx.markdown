I never thought I'd say it, but I am *so sick of cheese* it's hard to
even put into words. I've had more eggs, cheese, and meat this weekend
than I care to describe, and I'm only five days into this stupid Atkins
bullshit.

 Then again, according to the scale this morning, I've already lost six
pounds, so I can't say it's not working.

 I sat up from 2:20a to 3:10a today on the toilet shitting my guts out.
Every time I thought I was done, more showed up. I have gas and I'm
afraid to fart because I may well blow my pants full. Somehow I think
it's my digestive tract revolting against my new diet.

 Oh, and I think I'm getting sick - my nose is all plugged up and my
throat is really dry regardless of the amount of liquid I drink.

 Sigh. What I wouldn't give for a piece of toast right now.

 Another thing I've noticed is that I have no energy. No carbs = no
fuel, baby. I wake up tired, I run through the day tired, and I get home
tired. I woke up Sunday morning at 9:00a or so and by 11:30a I was ready
for a nap. Seriously. I'm dead on my feet right now, too.

 If Dr. Atkins wasn't already dead, I'd fucking kill him myself.

 Jenn and I rented the game [*Starsky &
Hutch*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A03AE/mhsvortex) for
PS2 this weekend, which is cool because one person drives the car while
the other person shoots out the window. Cooperative two-player game,
right? Well, then we ran into the problem where you can't shoot very
well using the standard controller because it's too hard to control the
crosshairs. But the game supports a steering wheel and a light gun
controller...

 ...So I went to the mall and bought [*Time Crisis
2*](http://www.namco.com/games/timecrisis2) with the [Guncon 2 light gun
controller](http://www.namco.com/support/guncon). Unfortunately, it
doesn't work on [my big
TV](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=SJhKOXohHTdKAkWgrFJAMjUsXjN0XCHEHY0=?CategoryName=tv_WEGAShowcase_WEGAShop_36to40TVsWEGAshowcase&ProductSKU=KV40XBR800&Dept=tv&Boutique=wega),
so I had to take it into the bedroom to play on the smaller one. Bah.
They need to fix that shit.

 Either way, now we can get about halfway through *Starsky & Hutch*
before it gets too hard. The *Time Crisis 2* game is *the bomb*, though,
so if you have a PS2, you definitely need to get it.
