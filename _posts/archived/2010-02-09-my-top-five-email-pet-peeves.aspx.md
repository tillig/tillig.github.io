I, like most of you, get a lot of email. We live in an email-centric
culture. I don't mind it so much. It just seems like some folks still
"don't get it." I've got some email pet peeves, I'm sure you do, too.
Here are some of mine:

**Subject-Line-Only Email with Long Subject**

If you have a quick thing to tell people, it's convenient to just stick
the message in the subject line.

> Out to lunch, back in 15 \<EOM\>

One less thing to open, right? That's helpful... except when your
subject line isn't really quick.

> I'm going to be late to work because I had a flat tire while I was
> taking my daughter to school so I'm going to the tire place to get it
> fixed. In by 9:30 \<EOM\>

[*Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nice shootin',
Tex.*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E33W1W?tag=mhsvortex) That's not a
subject-line-only email. That's a full,
put-the-message-in-the-message-body email. I have to actually *scroll
the subject line* in the tiny Outlook subject line area to see all of
that. Not helpful.

**Forward Upon Forward Upon Forward**

Getting jokes in the mail is de rigueur for email. It'd be nice to just
get the joke, though, and not see the 350-forward-long chain of headers
tracing the joke back to 1997 when it first started. It's also nice to
see the joke just one time in the email, not 17 copies of the joke as
people got tired of scrolling through the headers to get there so they
copied the whole thing up to the top. Again.

Here are some helpful steps for forwarding a joke:

Stop for a minute. Decide if it's really actually funny enough to bother
forwarding in the first place.

You didn't actually stop to think, you just clicked the button. Really,
this time, stop for a second. If you didn't laugh out loud - *actually
laugh out loud*, not just "LOL" - it's not good enough, so don't forward
it.

After hitting the forward button, wait before hitting "Send." You're not
done.

Delete all of the stupid headers that show up above the joke. That
includes:

-   The "Forwarded Message" garbage with all of the email addresses of
    past recipients.
-   The "Hey, I saw this and thought it was great!" commentary inserted
    by previous recipients.
-   All of the email signatures including the ones saying something
    about how this is a confidential email and you shouldn't be
    forwarding it.
-   Anything below the joke that isn't the joke or may be duplicate
    copies of the joke.

Once the only thing remaining in that email is the joke, and only one
copy of the joke, fine, go ahead and send it.

**Giant Video File Attachments**

I'm not sure about the rest of you, but even if it's the funniest thing
in the world, when someone sends me a 10MB video file through email it
goes straight to the trash. I'm really not interested in downloading it,
saving it somewhere, firing up a media player to watch three minutes of
a kid hitting his dad in the nuts with a wiffle ball bat.

We have [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) nowadays to host these things.
Do a search for whatever it is you're going to forward. It's probably on
there. If it's not already on YouTube, get a free account on YouTube and
post the video. Send me *a link to the video, not the whole video file*.

**Broken Embedded Images**

If you're forwarding an email with a ton of embedded images, make sure
they're going to come through. This is sort of a tricky thing because
some mail programs don't keep them from forward to forward, in which
case the recipient gets an email that has a bunch of text that's
supposed to be interspersed with humorous images but really just reads
like a monkey with ADHD.

> Check out these hilarious animals!
>
> \<broken image\>
>
> Mom loves to hold her babies!
>
> \<broken image\>
>
> Riding a bike!
>
> \<broken image\>
>
> Oh, no, watch out for that banana!
>
> \<broken image\>

Maybe try forwarding it to yourself - really - before sending it to
everyone in your address book. A dry run doesn't cost you anything.

**Check Your Facts**

There are a lot of rumors out there that sound funny or cool and they
compel you, almost like "[the power of Christ compels
you](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/quotes)," to click that forward
button.

*Stop.*

[Take a quick visit to Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/), where they can
dispel almost any internet rumor and include proof about whether it's
true or not.

*Do not assume that other people will check your facts for you.* They,
your friends and other address book contacts, are assuming that you
actually know what you're talking about. You're a smart person, why
would you steer them wrong?

They're going to visit some dinner party at the governor's house and
bring this thing up about how the pope was abducted by aliens or
whatever, and the people there who could make or break their career are
going to look at them like they're complete morons because *those people
at the dinner party check their facts*.

**I'm Sure There's More...**

... but I'll leave it at that for now. I mean, I could also go off on a
diatribe about poor grammar and spelling making emails nearly
unreadable, but that's more a general written communication issue than
email-specific.

**What are your email pet peeves?**
