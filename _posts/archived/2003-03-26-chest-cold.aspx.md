My chest cold continues. I thought I was getting better this morning
when I woke up because the phlegm in my chest and throat started
breaking up. By the time I got to work, it had solidified again in a war
against me and my poor lungs.

 I'm also feeling sort of tired and achey, almost like I have a fever
but not quite. I'm generally feeling sluggish, and that's not so good
when you're at work and people actually want you to *do* something. So
I'm going to go home at 3:00p, which is in about an hour. That'll give
me enough time to get the rest of the stuff done that I have pending
(for today, at least) and still allow me time to beat the rush hour
traffic.

 When I get home, I'm going to lay down and take a *huge nap*. Somehow a
nap always seems to fix everything.

 Maybe I need to get [this
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0943914957/mhsvortex) so I
can convince my boss of that, too.
