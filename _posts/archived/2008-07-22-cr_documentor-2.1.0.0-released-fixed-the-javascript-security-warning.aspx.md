I just posted the new version of CR_Documentor, version 2.1.0.0, [over
at Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/). This new one
hosts a tiny internal web server (instead of manually poking things into
the IE DOM) so as long as you can get to localhost, you should be able
to see the preview without [that nasty
warning](/archive/2008/07/14/cr_documentor-known-issue-javascript-security-warning.aspx).
I also fixed the focus issue so it shouldn't steal focus when the
preview refreshes.

If you upgraded before and are ready for a fix, [go get
it!](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/)
