Yesterday was *the worst*. I had planned on getting a whole bunch of
stuff done, but what ended up happening was me waking up with this
stomach bug. I never get sick, like, ever, and this was horrible.
Sweats, aches... gastrointestinal issues... It sucked. A lot.
 
 Jenn had this same thing on Tuesday and I underestimated how crappy it
makes you feel because, well, like I said - I don't really get sick.
Holy cow, was I wrong. I think I took well over the recommended daily
maximum of darn close to every drug in the house. Slept most of the day.
My parents came over for a little bit, but that's the most that really
happened.
 
 Thankfully, it seems like it may have run its course. I'm still kind of
achey and tired and I didn't get much sleep last night... decided to
just get up at 4:00a today because sleep wasn't happening... but I'm not
having all of the issues I was having yesterday. That's not to say I'm
going to be running around and such, but hopefully it won't chew into
work tomorrow.
 
 Follow up from
[Friday](/archive/2006/03/24/looking-into-board-games.aspx) - I ended up
getting [*Ticket to Ride
Europe*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/14996) at the game store, and
it's pretty fun. Jenn and I played a couple of rounds Friday and had a
good time with it. I think my biggest problem right now with board games
is that the premises are kind of lame. I mean, building a train route
across the country just doesn't sound like fun when you read it on the
back of the box, regardless of whether the play is actually good. I
don't regret picking the game up, and I may well get me a copy of
[*Puerto Rico*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3076) now that I know
the premise isn't everything... but I'd be stoked to see more fun games
that *sound cool, too*.
