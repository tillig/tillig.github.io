I don't normally go for the electric version of health products. I use a
non-electric razor. I don't blow-dry my hair. You get what I'm saying.
 
 I did give in and buy an electric toothbrush, though, at the behest of
my dentist. [Oral-B CrossAction
Power](http://www.oralb.com/products/product.asp?tid=productsâŠ‚power&cid=power&pid=crossactionmax).
 
 It's been time to get a new head for a while now, but I can't seem to
find any replacement. I've tried for like a month now.
 
 Turns out [there's been a recall on
them](http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/recalls/recall-102704.html). New heads
won't be available until January. Unbelievable. I think stores should
post that stuff so people like me don't wonder how come nobody sells
them anymore. Or at least tell the employees so I can ask and don't just
get the, "I dunno... I guess we're out of stock" thing.
