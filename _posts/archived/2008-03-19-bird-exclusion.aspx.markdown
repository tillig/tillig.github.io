A couple of weeks back we had some birds move into the walls of the
house.

See, we've got two [dormers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormer) on the
front of the house and just under the [eave
overhang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eave) on each side of the dormers
where the dormer meets the main roof (so four places), the builder
didn't actually finish the siding... so there were four places wide open
for small creatures to move in. Apparently this is very common, at least
in this area.

Anyway, I was working in one of the rooms upstairs and I heard this
scratching noise. Going outside and looking up, I could see all sorts of
nest-makings coming down the roof out of the hole in the siding.

I ended up having to call a guy and he came in, got all the bird stuff
out of the walls, and blocked up all the holes with metal screen. I'd
have done it myself, but our roof has a really steep pitch and, frankly,
I am not a handy person and have no idea what I'm doing. I'll pay
someone else to risk their neck and do it right any day of the week.

If you ever get in that situation and you're in the Portland, OR area,
well... first, I'm sorry, because that sucks. Second, the guy I called
was Ed Belding from Evergreen Pest Management - (503) 925-9752. Great
service, reasonable prices, and he does more than just birds. Give him a
call, he'll hook you up.

Now to address the bathtub that's started a spiderweb crack upstairs...
