I've always enjoyed the concept of highly detailed and accurate
costumes. This crap they sell on the market for $15 that includes the
shirt, hat, boot covers, and a laser gun all in one package might fly
for less detail-oriented folks or people short on time, but I'm a big
fan of authenticity.

 The problem is, I generally end up being one of the "short on time"
crowd, so I half-ass myself a costume at the last minute involving a
quick trip to the military surplus store and a liberal application of
creativity involving everyday household items. Halloween shows up
altogether too quickly and the night before I'm cobbling something
together. It kills me, too - I'd like to have something better than
that. If I'm going as Dracula, I want a pair of [custom
fangs](http://www.dnash.com/products/customfangs/index.html) and a
high-quality cape. I have yet to be a Ghostbuster because I need
[accurate props](http://archive.ghostbusters.net/props/) with [real
working
electronics](http://www.hyperdynelabs.com/products_elec_protonLight.php).

 This year I'm taking the project on early, though: I'm going to be
Willy Wonka (from [the new
movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/)).

 Jenn and I went last night to the fabric store and I ended up picking
up three patterns - one for a coat (which will need to have the collar
slightly modified); one for a shirt (I'll have to find some paisley
fabric); and one for a civil war jacket which, once the sleeves and
collar are removed, looks just like his vest. I've also purchased some
finials that can be used as the handle on his walking stick and I've
ordered some [clear PVC pipe](http://www.clearpvcpipe.com) for the body
of it.

 I'm getting a head start so I can actually make all this stuff and go
for the authentic look. Now, admittedly, I'm already conceding a few of
the details. I won't be able to get the "W" pin he has at his collar.
I'm not a good enough tailor to make a coat that has pinstripes that
match up so I'm going to go with a solid color instead. The shoes
probably won't be quite right, and the bottom of the pants (if I go with
a pair I have already) won't be right, either. And I can't find the
actual finial that was on his cane, nor can I find quite the right tip
for it, either, but we'll make due. Oh, and there's no way I'm springing
for a real top hat. The point is, it'll be of a much higher quality (and
will be much more fun) than the $15 kit.

 Of course, the patterns already cost me $25, the finials were $15,
and the PVC pipe was $30 with shipping (it only comes in 10' sections).
So budget-wise, I'm way over the typical Halloween costume budget
already. It'll be fun to make, though, and I think that's really what
matters. Plus I'll be happier with it when it's done. I'll keep you
posted.

**UPDATE 10/02/05**: The costume came out well. [Here are the
details.](/archive/2005/10/02/wonka-costume-complete.aspx)
