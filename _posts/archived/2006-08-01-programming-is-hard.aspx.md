[Programming Is Hard](http://programmingishard.com/) is a site for
sharing common code snippets and links. Sort of like
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) for code.

 Is this really a time saver, or is it a bad idea? I mean, sure,
grabbing some common functionality from somewhere might get you going a
little quicker, but remember [Scott's Rule of Programming
\#0x3eA](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MovingViewStateToTheSessionObjectAndMoreWrongheadedness.aspx)

- "Just because code is on the Internet doesn't mean you should cut and
paste it into your production system." It occurs to me that something
like this is asking for all nature of trouble. You *know* that the
entry-level developer sitting two cubes down from you just grabbed some
code off this thing and pasted it, entirely unchecked, into a block of
code that barely compiles.

 On the other hand, folks have experimented with putting incorrect data
into [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and found the incorrect data
doesn't stay there very long before someone corrects it. Will that same
level of policing go on with these code snippets?

 I think maybe there should be some nature of moderation - like you
submit a snippet and then it has to be reviewed before going on the
site. Or maybe that's asking too much, and a free-for-all really is the
way to go, with the implicit "buyer beware" disclaimer.
