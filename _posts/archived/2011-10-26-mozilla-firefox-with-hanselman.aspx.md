Bing released a [Firefox With Bing
addon](http://www.firefoxwithbing.com/), which prompted Scott Hanselman
to tweet a bit:

[![Ok, can we get a Mozilla Firefox with Hanselman branded browser
now?]({{ site.url }}/images/20111026hanseltweet.png)](https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman/status/129245138013782016)

Looking at the addon code, it was released under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL
2.1 so...

In response to the peoples' demand, I present to you

[Firefox With
Hanselman](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C2CB832A5EC9B707!45336&authkey=!AG1axtdwCjahmKQ&ithint=file%2cxpi)

([Click to get the
addon](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C2CB832A5EC9B707!45336&authkey=!AG1axtdwCjahmKQ&ithint=file%2cxpi).)

This addon does pretty much exactly what the Bing addon does:

-   Set your home page to
    [http://www.hanselman.com/](http://www.hanselman.com/)
-   Add a search provider so you can search Scott's web site.

Free. No warranty expressed or implied. Works on my machine, etc.
