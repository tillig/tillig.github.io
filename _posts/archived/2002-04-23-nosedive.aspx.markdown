Fucking [Lattice Semiconductor](http://www.latticesemi.com) took a
*nosedive* today, closing *down **\$4.31***. Normally I don't care a
whole lot about that, but Lattice happens to be one of the *two*
companies I hold stock in. I was hoping they'd come out of the slump so
my purchase of my stock options might not be in utter vain, but that
doesn't seem to be the case. Instead, I will probably have to write
these assholes off as a loss, which means I'm totally screwed since I
don't have a house and don't have enough stuff to deduct to really make
any use of losses.
 
 The long and the short of it is, these bitches won't come out of
donkey-suck land any time soon, I'm thinking, since I sold half my
stupid options to buy the other half of my stupid options *back when
they were at \$29*. What the hell am I supposed to do with it at fucking
\$12?
