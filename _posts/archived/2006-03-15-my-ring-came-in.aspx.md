![Black titanium 'One
Ring']({{ site.url }}/images/20060315ring.jpg)Jenn
ordered my wedding ring online and, after a reasonably significant
education for both of us in not only the German language but also how to
make international wire transfers, it finally arrived.

 [It's a black titanium *Lord of the Rings* "One
Ring."](http://www.olivern.org/product_info.php?products_id=70&cPath=7_19)
I think it's awesome and, being titanium, won't get destroyed as easily
as other stuff I might get. Jenn's still getting used to it since it's
not the traditional gold band.

 Apparently it's luck we even got the thing. After wading through their
site using [Google Language
Tools](http://www.google.com/language_tools?hl=en) and getting the size
calculated and everything, after figuring out how to get the wire
transfer done, and after beating our heads against trying to contact the
online store, it turns out they don't actually accept orders that ship
to the US and the only reason they sent it was because they already had
our money. Bad online store design, folks - if you don't offer shipping
to the country, don't offer it as an option.

 Regardless, I'm stoked. The ring rocks. One more item off the
checklist.
