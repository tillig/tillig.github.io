Well, I knew my good mood couldn't last forever, and after Sunday's
beating, it didn't have much left to it. Today pretty much killed it
off.

 I've fought with things pretty much all day long to get them to work
correctly. I mean, everything down to the *weather* was against me.

 I went during lunch to UPS my PS2 to Sony. It was clear when I looked
out the window then it started raining buckets as soon as I stepped out
the door. I got to the UPS place and stood in this ridiculous line for
like 20 minutes, then as soon as I was done, the rain stopped. Fucking
figures.

 Our marketing department pisses me off, too. We recently put out a
press release telling people at the bottom of the release to "go request
such-and-such whitepaper at the web site." Prior to release, I informed
the marketers that we *don't have anywhere for people to request such
things*. Do I need to create something? "No, they'll just email us." Are
you sure? I mean, people see something like that, and they want a form.
"No, don't worry about it. They'll just email us." Fine.

 The request came in today - around a week later - that they need a form
for this whitepaper thing. Except now it's a *last minute emergency*
instead of something I could actually have taken some good time with and
made extensible and functional. *Thanks for the forethought, guys!*
Everything with marketing is always a fucking fire drill. One would
think that, as capable humans, they'd learn by now. Maybe I'm
overestimating their abilities. After all, these *are* the people who
gave the graphic designer full credit for the web site I built.
