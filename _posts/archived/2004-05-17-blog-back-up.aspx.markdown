Sorry for the downtime, folks. I've had some troubles with my hosting
situation and I think I've got everything worked out now. I'd like to
say "we now return you to your regularly scheduled program," but I've
sort of lost some entries (about a week's worth, some of them I really
wish I hadn't lost since they were from my move) so instead I'd like to
ask anyone out there who might have any entries past 4/9 cached, say in
their RSS reader or something, to please send them in to me so I can
re-post. I'll still be trying to recover them (I do have backups, I just
have to *get the person who has them to email them*), but in the
meantime...
 
 Well, I guess that does mean "we now return you to your regularly
scheduled program."
 
 I'll send out an email later today to the folks who wanted to be
notified I'm back up. Of course, that's not too many folks, but that's
okay. You know who you are.
