Looks like Lutz is [looking to do soemthing
different](http://blog.lutzroeder.com/2008/08/future-of-net-reflector.html).
He's [handed off the development of
Reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/index.htm) to [Red
Gate](http://www.red-gate.com/).

![Red Gate's .NET
Reflector](https://hyqi8g.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y2pgUtqQ8d9VS7KrGDrBylNkti-NWuMquZjnJ4GqE1a1XeB9v7Ll31QmlJ4vNUMoBEj97xjxXRCd2h5SatOZ8tMhiSTosb-CvL21UxmfDloUIo/20080820redgatereflector.jpg?psid=1)

Wow. This is huge. I'm interested to see what his next move is. (This is
particularly interesting to me since I started
[CR_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) based on his
original Documentor project.)
