I may have narrowly escaped getting thrown into a bullpen - a many, many
person shared cube - because I called it like it is:
 
 First, my productivity would go to shit. I can't concentrate when there
are a bunch of other people sitting in the same room. I don't care how
quiet it is; the fact they're there is distracting.
 
 Second, it's psychologically problematic for me. Seriously. Just
*thinking* about sitting in a room with a bunch of people all day makes
my blood pressure go up. I don't think I'm necessarily anthropophobic or
agoraphobic or anything, but I do feel pretty traumatized to be forced
into a large, shared environment. If I was in jail, I'd probably *ask*
for solitary confinement.
 
 Anyway, crisis averted for the time being.
