We haven't done a Traffic Asshole of the Week for a while, so let's give
you two in one shot.

 The setup: Once a year in my neighborhood they advertise in the paper
for a development-wide garage sale. Everyone with something to sell can
pop their garage doors open and hawk their wares. This causes a parking
nightmare as everyone in the neighboring states floods into my
development to buy up junk.

 The photo: Taken through my front window blinds. Let's study this one:

 ![Two parking assholes in

 There are two (2) assholes in this one.

 The first one is the blue minivan clearly parked right in front of my
driveway. That's parked - not "we let someone off and kept the engine
running," but fully "we shut off the engine and don't plan on moving
while people with us are walking up and down the block." (These folks
watched me stare them down through my front window and ignored me...
until they saw me pull the camera out, then decided maybe parking
illegally in front of my driveway wasn't the greatest idea and pulled
out.)

 The second asshole is the green SUV across the street. Two issues with
this guy. First, he's parked facing the wrong way (at least in Oregon,
you must park in the direction cars travel; this is a two-way street, so
he's parked facing the wrong way). Second, he's facing the wrong way
whilst (and at the same time) being parked *on a block marked "No
Parking."*

 Sometimes, you have to wish you drove a tow truck.
