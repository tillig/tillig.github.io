Went out yesterday to get some spider webs off my front door and saw
possibly the hugest ant infestation *ever*. All the way around the
house, up and around my front door, then down the front stairs. Tiny
little black ones (so small you can see through 'em).
 
 Out came the Raid and washed the bad ants out.
 
 I swept up the ant bodies and got a pile about six inches in diameter
and maybe half an inch tall. Yes, that many ants. I probably should have
taken a picture, but I was pretty grossed out.
 
 Turns out they were coming from this hole near the side of the house.
Flooded that with Raid and I haven't seen anything emerging from the
hole since. Here's hoping I got 'em.
