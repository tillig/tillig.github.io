Well, the TV repair shop called again. They still don't see what I'm
talking about. No problems over there.

 I'm going in today at noon to check it out and verify with my own eyes
that this thing isn't messed up. I'll stop by home to get my test DVD to
see, once and for all, if it's just environmental.

 If it's environmental, honestly, I have no idea what I'll do. I guess
I'll have to sell it or something and get some TV that's not affected by
"my environment." Or I'll have to do a load of experiments to see if I
can determine what the environmental effect is. I have no freaking clue.
If it's seriously not reproducible, basically, I'm hosed.

 Anyone interested in a 40" Sony TV?
