Just when I had gotten all of the [*Harry Potter*
Legos](http://shop.lego.com/department.asp?d=20&t=3), they released the
[Prisoner of Azkaban
series](http://shop.lego.com/leaf.asp?Type=4&d=20&t=3&c=4D1F4B67-ECB2-478B-ADB6-5F8708DBB15A).
And some of them are rehashes of sets they already put out, which is
just annoying. Bitches!
