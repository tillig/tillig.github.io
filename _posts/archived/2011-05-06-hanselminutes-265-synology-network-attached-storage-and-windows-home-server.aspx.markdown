I recently had the opportunity to chat with [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com) about our experiences with Synology
DiskStation products and Windows Home Server. Looks like the podcast is
up now so [go check that out if you haven't
already](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=285).

If you're coming in here after having listened to the podcast, here are
some links to related blog entries you may be interested in:

    DS1010+](/archive/2010/05/20/moving-to-a-synology-ds1010.aspx): This
    is where I talk about the various reasons I picked the DS1010+ and
    my experience getting data onto it.
-   [Overview of My Media Center
    Solution](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx):
    The whole reason I needed a NAS device originally was to store my
    media. This article explains what I've got set up and how it comes
    together.

    Server](/archive/2008/09/08/two-weeks-in-with-windows-home-server-what-ive-learned.aspx):
    Some impressions of WHS that I jotted down after having it set up
    for a while.

    Upgrades](/archive/2008/09/28/home-server-upgrades.aspx): Describes
    the upgrade I did to get more memory and drive capacity.

Also, if you're a regular Hanselminutes listener, your trivia for the
day (which we touch on in the podcast): [The original definition of
Hanselminutes](/archive/2005/03/22/hanselingo.aspx).

Finally, thanks again to Scott for having me on the show. A good time
was had by all.
