We recently switched from Frontier back to Comcast because we were
having issues with Frontier's customer service and pricing. Plus,
Frontier is really trying to get out of the TV game and we like our TV
features, so Comcast got us back. (I was also pretty tired of [Frontier
remotely reprogramming my
router](/archive/2009/04/04/verizon-fios-router-auto-updating-and-configuration-problems.aspx)
and then denying it.)

Anyway, Comcast gives you a cable modem but no router, so I ended up
getting a [Netgear
WNDR3700v2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002HWRJY4?tag=mhsvortex) for a
replacement. That freed up my [D-Link
DAP-1522](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001769K3O?tag=mhsvortex) to move
upstairs and become a wireless bridge.

After moving everything around, [my
network](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx)
looks like this:

So far it's working very well, with the exception of a couple of recent
dropouts in the 2.4GHz wireless on the router. I've [updated the
firmware on it to the
latest](http://support.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/19250/),
which is supposed to take care of that, and... so far, so good.
