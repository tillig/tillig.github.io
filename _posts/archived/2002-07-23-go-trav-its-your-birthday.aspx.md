Yay, me, it's my BIRTHDAY!

 Thus far, I've already had two donuts for my birthday. Granted, that
was in our staff meeting where there's always donuts, but hey - they're
birthday donuts as far as I'm concerned.

 Later today there's a birthday celebration in the other building here
at work for all the July birthdays. Cake and ice cream there. And *on*
my birthday. All the better.

 Tonight my parents are having a barbecue at their place for my
immediate family and Jenn's parents. I think this will be the first time
Jenn's parents have actually spent time at an event with mine. Should be
interesting.

 Speaking of family events, I saw the movie [*My Big Fat Greek
Wedding*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0259446) last week. Friday, I think.
Anyway, it was really, really funny. I learned two things from that
movie: First, that Jenn's family is probably part Greek ("I have 27
*first cousins*..."). Christmas at her grandma's house is a lot like the
wedding preparations you see in the movie. Second, any illness can be
cured by [Windex](http://www.windexglasscleaner.com/). I've yet to
verify this latter point.

 My baby Xev kitty is a demon in cat's clothing. She's *so wild all the
time*. Sometimes I wonder if she actually sleeps. I'm beginning to think
she likes being squirted with the water bottle. I do know that she likes
playing in the sink, and when we're not looking she'll jump up onto our
kitchen counter, run to the sink, and start drinking the water soaking
on the dirty dishes. She's very bad. If she wasn't so cute, I'd be
forced to kick her ass. She's starting to play well with Semper (the
other cat), though. It's kind of funny to watch - Semper is like 16
pounds and Xev is maybe 3 pounds. It's sort of like a squirrel playing
with a polar bear.

 That's about it. So far, my 26th is just another day in a long line of
days. I'll probably have more tomorrow once the barbecue has taken
place.
