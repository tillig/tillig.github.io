I called the [mortgage broker that a friend of mine
recommended](http://www.mortgagexps.com/bethboler.html) at about 10:00a
today. I got in touch with her assistant, who told me that I'd be
getting a call back at 11:00a, after the broker got out of a meeting.
 
 It's 11:25a right now, and I've not gotten any calls.
 
 I appreciate that people are busy and whatnot, but I value punctuality.
Don't tell me - or have your *assistant* tell me - that you're going to
call me back if you're not.
 
 It doesn't help that I sent this broker an email on Monday and never
heard back, either. This whole thing smells rotten. I'm wondering if I
should just look for someone else. I mean, if I can't count on calls
getting returned or emails getting answered, why would I trust this
person with the largest purchase I'm bound to make?
 
 Greg told me I should talk to three different brokers anyway, to make
sure I'm getting the best deal. I don't think that's too bad of an idea,
but it does mean a lot more work on my part. I suppose in the long run
it'll be worth it.
 
 \*Sigh\*
 
 I wish this were easier, like buying a car. I suppose technically I
could go to the "house lot" and pick out a house, but I'm not too big on
the whole *manufactured home thing*. If only they could make
manufactured homes as nice as regular homes.
 
 I had an idea, too, and I'm not sure whether to go with it or not...
For the first time home buyer, like me, it would be nice to see a
journal-style account of some other first time home buyer's experience
getting a house. I'm thinking I may start a new category for blog
entries and start the journal there. Then maybe it'll be helpful to
someone down the road. Or, maybe, just for me, to look back and see all
the stupid mistakes I made. Hmmm. Maybe that's not such a great idea.
