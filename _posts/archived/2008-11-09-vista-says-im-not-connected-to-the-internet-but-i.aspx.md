Was messing about on the computer this morning when I noticed that Vista
thinks I'm not connected to the Internet, even though I am. The "Network
and Sharing Center" says I have "Local Only" access right now... but I
can get to sites on the Internet, so obviously that's very wrong.

As it turns out, [this is a known issue for Vista and Windows 2008
computer that have more than one network
adapter](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947041). My computer has a
wireless and a wired adapter, so I guess I qualify. I found a little
additional discussion (not much) [in a forum
thread](http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3752907&SiteID=17).
Not sure why it just started doing this today; it was working fine
before. No network changes have happened... except I had to reboot my
router yesterday. I wonder if that's what started it. Maybe another
router reboot is in order.
