I bought these very tasty [Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme
cookies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYDHTM?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000AYDHTM)
a while ago at Costco. They sort of make me crave them. Anyway, the
other day I was drinking a lemon drop and thought, "what would this be
like if I used vanilla vodka instead of plain?" The answer: very much
like the lemon creme filling in the cookies.

A little experimentation later and I came up with a drink that
approximates the flavor of the cookies. You'll need limoncello, vanilla
vodka, sweet and sour mix, and candied ginger. When you go to the store
for the candied ginger, buy it in bulk and make sure to get some of the
sugar that collects at the bottom of the bulk bin - you'll need that.

Now, combine the following in a shaker:

-   1.5 oz limoncello
-   1.5 oz vanilla vodka
-   a splash of sweet and sour mix
-   a generous pinch of that sugar from the candied ginger

Shake that up and pour it in a martini glass. Garnish with a long slice
of candied ginger (long enough to stick out of the drink like a cinnamon
stick, or else it'll just sort of float in there and might look nasty).

At the end of the drink, which is pretty sweet, the garnish will have
soaked up some of that lemon and will be a very tasty treat at the end.
