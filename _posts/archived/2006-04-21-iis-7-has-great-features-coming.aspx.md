[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) has a great article
about some of the [IIS 7 features coming in Windows Vista and
Longhorn](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/20/443513.aspx).
Included:
-   HttpHandlers and HttpModules can participate in any server request,
    not just for .NET apps.
-   ASP.NET configuration system integrated into IIS (web.config for all
    apps!).
-   Admin GUI that combines administration of IIS and ASP.NET settings.
-   Better error auditing/debugging through a new system called "Failed
    Request Event Buffering."
-   Vastly improved APIs (check out the example of the simplest program
    ever that can enumerate the worker processes and current requests).
    [Check this
    out](http://blogs.msdn.com/carlosag/archive/2006/04/17/MicrosoftWebAdministration.aspx)
    for more on the API updates. Bye bye, WMI!


 I'm stoked. Seriously. All of this stuff is going to make the ASP.NET
world so much easier to work in. I've already started shooting emails
off to folks around work about ways we can leverage these things.
