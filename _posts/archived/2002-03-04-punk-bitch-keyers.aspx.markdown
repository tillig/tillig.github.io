Having season hockey tickets for the [Winter
Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com), I parked my car at the local
[MAX](http://www.tri-met.org/max/) stop to ride in to the [Rose Garden
Arena](http://www.rosequarter.com/) for the Friday night game. This is
not an unusual procedure.
 
 This time it was different, though.
 
 I got back to my car after the game and drove it home. No problem,
right? Well, when I went to drive out to a friend's place the next
morning, I noticed that *some punk bitch decided to key my car*.
 
 There is now a big line from the upper passenger-side of the hood
diagonal down to the headlight on the driver's side. It's a two-part
line; you can see where the asshole's arm wasn't long enough to do it in
one swipe, so he/she *adjusted position and continued keying*. It's
probably a good three feet long.
 
 I feel sort of like John Travolta ("Vincent") in *Pulp Fiction*, where
he's talking to Eric Stoltz ("Lance") while buying heroin. He has his
car in storage for three years, then it's out five days and someone keys
it.
 
 VINCENT: I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give
anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I
coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?
 
 LANCE: It's chicken shit. You don't fuck with another man's vehicle.
 
 Even more than having the asshole key my car, what bothered me was that
I was going to have to go through the insurance company hassle. I've
been through this before, where you have to schedule time to take the
car to a claims office, have them take pictures, fill out the paperwork,
etc., then do the same stupid thing at the auto body shop, then wait for
the check to arrive, etc. What a pain.
 
 But it wasn't like that this time. Since the last time I had a claim,
I've switched car insurance from Nationwide to
[Progressive](http://www.progressive.com). It was *so much easier* to
deal with things through them! I filed the claim at noon on Sunday. 45
minutes later, I was talking to a claims adjuster. 60 minutes after
that, *there was a guy at my house* taking the pictures, doing the
estimate, etc. Had I not just renewed my policy (every six months,
right?), he'd have cut me a check on the spot. Too bad for me; I will
get a check in the mail in a couple of days. Shucks. And I was looking
forward to the annoying hassle of insurance companies. *Not.* I totally
recommend these Progressive folks. Check 'em out. Not only did they save
me money, the customer service, so far as I can tell, is *the bomb*.
 
 So, anyway, that should [hopefully] be fixed by the end of the week.
Pending on how soon the check gets here, that is. I'll call the auto
body shop and find out when they've got an opening.
