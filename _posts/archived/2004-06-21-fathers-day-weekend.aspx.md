This weekend was Father's Day, which meant carting around town visiting
family.

 Saturday night we hung out at my parents' condo and visited with them,
my sisters, mom's sisters, and mom's dad. Not sure where my dad's
parents were.

 Granddad got going on telling a story and had us rolling. Apparently
his dog likes to sleep under the footrest of his recliner while Granddad
watches TV. One time there was a power failure and Granddad got up to
get a lantern so he could see, but when he came back, he couldn't find
his dog. He looked all over the house and came to the conclusion that,
in his words, "The devil done shut off my lights and stole my dog!" (How
hilarious is that? The best writers in Hollywood would never come up
with "the devil done shut off my lights and stole my dog." Too funny.)
Turns out when he stood up, he pushed the dog under the recliner with
the footrest and trapped the dog under the chair. Heh.

 Sunday afternoon we had lunch with Jenn's family at [Marie
Callender's](http://www.mcpies.com/). Pretty tasty, and we all ended up
with leftovers.

 All in all, a good weekend hanging out with the family. Not
particularly restful, but a good weekend nonetheless.

 Went to [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/) to check out paint
colors for the bathrooms. Our entire house is the same color of white
inside - trim, doors, walls, etc. - so we need a little color. Found
some great stuff and will have to get on that as soon as we get money.

 Spent a little at [Bed, Bath, and
Beyond](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/), too, picking up some new
bathroom rugs to replace the ones the cats have torn up and have seen
better days. Plus, we had to get something that goes with [the shower
curtain we bought last
weekend](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=104359&RN=10&).

 In other news, I think I have a little athlete's foot - minor, but
annoying - on my right foot. Not sure how I got it since I don't go
tromping around in public showers or really ever go around barefoot, but
it's there and it's created a weird sort of dry spot that occasionally
itches. At least, I think it's athlete's foot. I dunno. The point is,
it's resistant to the over-the-counter Lotrimin I've been using, so I
figured I should go see a dermatologist to make sure I'm even dealing
with it correctly. Made the appointment this morning for *three weeks
from now*. That's the soonest they could get me in! Seems dermatology's
in high demand around here. I'd say I should have been a dermatologist,
but I'm sure you see some pretty disgusting shit in that line of work. I
have issues picking up cat puke; no way am I dealing with skin
diseases.
