and now that's done the costume proper is done.

 Wow. That's a little more than I was planning on spending, but it looks
*awesome*. Plus, it was fun to put together and kept me busy in a
creative fashion, so that counts for something, doesn't it?

 I don't want the final look getting out quite yet, so I'll post
pictures on or after Halloween. I think it looks pretty good, though,
and Jenn says so, too.
