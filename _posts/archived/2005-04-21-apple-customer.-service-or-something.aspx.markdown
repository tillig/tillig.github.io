I bought a new 4G 60GB iPod Photo a while ago, and it's just slightly
larger than the 3G iPod I had (*thanks*, Apple!) so now I gotta buy a
new dock that fits the new iPod, a new case, etc.

 I bought the [CEO Classic case from
Marware](http://www.marware.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Marware.woa/3/wa/selectedCategory?catalogCatID=163).
I got it yesterday, and I dig it, but it's a pretty snug fit.

 I ordered a new dock and power converter for the iPod directly from
Apple's online store.

 They don't tell you during that order process that they *require an
in-person signature* when your stuff is delivered.

 I mean, I understand if you're delivering my new $5000 computer or
something, but this is $50 worth of crap I would have bought at the
local Apple store if they weren't out of stock.

 So I got this stupid FedEx sticker on my door that says I have to be
there in person and can't just sign to have it released. I called FedEx
to inform them that I have, you know, *a job*, and I can't be home all
day, so can they please tell me when it'll be delivered.

 They gave me the window of "sometime between 8:00a and 8:00p." You
thought the cable company was bad. That rules, FedEx. Even UPS will hook
me up with a decent window.

 That, plus FedEx Ground doesn't have any customer service in my area,
so I can't just go pick it up at the drop center.

 My only option was to call Apple support, which I did, and I think I
got connected to Australia because the guy's accent was super thick and
the telephone ringing sound was definitely not US. I talked to the guy
and he said they absolutely could not let my stuff out without an
in-person signature.

 Fine, buddy. Get me your supervisor. I don't care - *get me fucking
Steve Jobs*. Someone best be delivering my shit or I'm going to go
*postal*.

 I get the Apple guy's supervisor, who gets on another line with FedEx,
and after like 10 minutes on hold (I think they were trying to wait me
out - "put the guy on hold... is he still there? yeah... stick him back
on hold, see if he hangs up") they somehow got FedEx to promise to
deliver this evening *after I get home from work*.

 How come that wasn't an option when I first called?

 Sigh. I guess we'll see how this comes out when I get home tonight.
