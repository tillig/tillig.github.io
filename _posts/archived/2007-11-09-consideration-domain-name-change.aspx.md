So I'm thinking about the fact that folks generally can't remember how
to spell "Paraesthesia."  I like the name, I've had it for a while, but
I think there's a memory barrier there.  I own "travisillig.com" (which
currently redirects you to my site).

What do folks out there think about the idea of making "travisillig.com"
my primary domain and having Paraesthesia redirect?  Would it be
easier?  Do you care?  It would be no trivial amount of work and I'd
lose a bit in the way of Google results/ranking for a while, so I want
to be sure if I start thinking about doing that.  (I would definitely
make sure any existing links out there would continue to work.)

What do you all think?
