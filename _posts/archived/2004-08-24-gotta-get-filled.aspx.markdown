I got my teeth cleaned this morning and, as seems to be the general
case, I gotta go back in. Apparently I have some sort of cavity starting
under where this retainer thing in my mouth is. I looked; I don't see
anything. I start to wonder if they're just trying to eke money out of
me \$60 out-of-pocket-expense at a time, but I know that if I don't get
it dealt with it will actually turn into something legitimate that I
really don't want to have anything to do with.
 
 So I have another appointment in a couple weeks to get that taken care
of. Preventative measures or whatever.
 
 The HR director just walked by and, without even seeing me, said,
"Travis must have moved down here." Heh. I think people know my decor
now.
 
 My new veal pen at work is much farther from the break area (water,
pop, microwaves, etc.) than my previous dwelling. Now not only am I
never getting up, but I'm thirsty all the time, too. Maybe I should be
less lazy about the whole thing and just succumb to thirst and get a
drink. Maybe I should pack a bag so I can make the return trip tomorrow,
too. Damn.
 
 I bought the [*Best of Triumph the Insult Comic
Dog*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002DB5OA/mhsvortex) DVD
today, so that should be coming soon. Another one of those fun party
discs to put in.
 
 Jenn's birthday is coming up and I don't know what to get her. If she
doesn't cough up for her season hockey ticket, she's getting that (but
she doesn't *want* that, so let's hope she musters up some cash). In
fact, she doesn't *know* what she wants, she only tells me one-off items
that she *doesn't* want. Since I am not psychic, I will wait for a list.
Should a list not arrive, *hockey ticket* it shall be.
