It was a pretty long week back at work after vacation last week. There
was a deadline today... well, I guess it's yesterday, now... Friday...
for the project I was working on. I got done what needed to get done,
but the stuff I was working on didn't really get tested too well, so
that'll have to happen next week.

 I got home after work Friday and, after some dinner and conversation,
decided it was time to re-enter [San
Andreas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001VGFK2/mhsvortex)
for a short period, which I did. Like, maybe only four hours. Heh.

 And now... It's time for bed. I'm too tired to play anymore (and win; I
could play and get killed repeatedly, but that's not really fun), but
I'm just slightly too awake to sleep. I figure I should probably just go
to bed, though. A friend of mine is coming over tomorrow night (that is,
*tonight*, Saturday night) and I should probably be awake enough to, you
know, *visit*.
