I'm not a big handyman. To be honest, I'm not even a little handyman. I
have some tools, I can hang a picture, but when it comes to anything
much beyond putting a couple of screws into a board or hammering a nail
into a wall, I'm pretty much out of it.

We're putting this thing together at home for our cat box to sit on. It
involves cutting a board, and I noticed that I don't really have a
saw. To remedy that, when we bought the board, I got a decent
mid-to-low-end circular saw. (I obviously don't have a ton of call for
such a thing, so spending more than, say, $50 would have been wasted.)

During my first-ever-in-my-lifetime use of a circular saw, I learned a
few things I thought I'd share to help out the other less-than-handy
people out there:

- Don't stand on the cord or the saw won't go.
- Don't pinch the cord between your leg and the table or the saw won't
    go.
- If the saw doesn't go, the cut doesn't come out as clean as you
    might hope.
- Stop over-thinking it and move the saw faster than a snail's pace or
    the cut won't be smooth.
- Sandpaper can go a long way in cleaning up a messy cut on MDF.
- MDF generates more sawdust than you will ever be able to clean up.
