After a long day of pressure washing my house, Jenn and I took the
evening and went to [Sylvia's](http://www.sylvias.net) for dinner and a
show.
 
 I had never been to a dinner theatre before, so it was an interesting
experience. I've been to stage productions of all types - from grade
school productions to Broadway (well, Broadway productions that come
touring, at least) - so I wasn't sure what to expect.
 
 Dinner was served about 6:30p. Jenn and I both opted for the pork loin
medallions in apple bourbon sauce, given a fixed menu and the other two
options not looking to our liking. We started with a drink each,
followed by a salad. Neither Jenn nor I are real salad-eaters, and
neither of us had eaten much that day, so while the salads were being
served, we gorged ourselves on the bread on the table.
 
 When the salads arrived, we each tried to eat them (Jenn did a better
job than I did) but we weren't too successful. Jenn actually started
feeling a little ill, almost as though the bread and alcohol in her
stomach were combating the health factors of the salad, Adam Sandler
style.
 
 **Salad**: I will make you strong and healthy!
 **Bread and Alcohol**: Fuck that, Salad! We're gonna beat you down!
 
 Dinner arrived and it was okay. I wouldn't say this is the best
restaurant in the entire world or anything, but I was there more for the
entertainment than the food.
 
 Speaking of entertainment, I started looking around at the people
attending. Now, I don't mean to get all bourgeois on you, but this was
definitely a proletariat crowd hanging out. I understand flip-flops are
(for some unknown reason) "in" lately, but with jeans, a button up
shirt, and a blazer? *Tack-ay!* Put some shoes on, for God's sake.
Where's your mother?
 
 We finished up dinner, and dessert was a poppy seed cake with raspberry
frosting. Tasty! Jenn was feeling ill, but in a Homer Simpson moment
decided she wasn't ill enough to not eat dessert. "Oh, man, Trav, I'm
not feeling so good... my stomach is rumbling and- OOOO! CAKE!"
 
 After dessert was cleared, the show started (around 8:30p or so). The
show we saw was called [*Monky
Business*](http://www.dramaticpublishing.com/catalogdetail.cfm?listcode=MD3),
a musical about some monks trying to save their monastery from being
torn down by having a radio telethon. It was really clever and well
played. I liked it a lot.
 
 All in all, a good experience. I'd recommend you check it out. I think
Jenn and I will try to make it again for the next show (they do four
different shows each year).
