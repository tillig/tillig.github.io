I'm a contributor to the [Autofac](http://autofac.googlecode.com)
project and recently they switched their repository from Subversion to
Mercurial which means I have to learn Mercurial. I've been working with
it a little and the workflow process is... not quite as intuitive to me
as Subversion, but then, it's a pretty big mental shift and I'm still
working on it.

These sites have helped me get up to speed and start understanding a bit
better. Maybe they'll help you, too:

- [Hg Init](http://hginit.com)
- [Mercurial Kick Start](http://mercurial.aragost.com/kick-start/)
- [A Guide to Branching in
    Mercurial](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/)

Got other good ones? Leave 'em in the comments!
