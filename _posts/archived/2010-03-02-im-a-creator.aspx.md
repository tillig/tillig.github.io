I went and took [this color
test](http://www.careerpath.com/career-tests/colorcareercounselor.aspx)
which does a sort of career analysis based on colors you like and
dislike.

It tries to get you to enroll in a school or something, so don't give it
your email address or anything, but it's interesting and appears fairly
accurate. Here's my result (along with a description of the test):

> The Dewey Color System® is now the world's most accurate career
> testing instrument. This report based on your personality traits
> indicates your two most enjoyable day-day-day occupation skills. It’s
> a summary of the full report, the Color Leadership Evaluation 5.0.
>
> Studies indicate workplace enjoyment is the key to success. So as you
> read, consider only "Was I mostly having fun at work?" Disregard your
> present and past employer’s environment.
>
> **Best Occupational Category 
> You're a CREATOR** 
> Keywords: Nonconforming, Impulsive, Expressive, Romantic, Intuitive,
> Sensitive, and Emotional
>
> These original types place a high value on aesthetic qualities and
> have a great need for self-expression. They enjoy working

> outdoor careers. They might also enjoy working with machines, tools,
> and equipment to repair or build something.

I think people who know me would see it as pretty right on. Given my
current occupation as a software engineer, I fall pretty close to where
it looks like I should be - a mix between creator and doer. I kinda wish
I had a little more in the way of "unstructured, flexible organizations"
to deal with, but... well, them's the breaks.

I wanted to be 3D modeler/animator at one point. That would have been
along these lines, too. Hmmm.
