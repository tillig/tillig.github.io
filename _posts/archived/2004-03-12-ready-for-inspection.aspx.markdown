My house inspection is at 1:00p today, so I'll be leaving pretty soon to
go do that. I guess it'll take about three hours, though I'm not sure
what I'm going to do during that time. The inspector's going to run
around and do his whole "inspection thing..." I'm assuming I don't need
to do anything unless there's a problem.
 
 Either way, I'll try to get some photos while I'm there so I can post
'em for you guys.
 
 Jenn and I are preparing for the move. With the movers scheduled, we've
got to get the boxes and start packing. Jenn picked some up this morning
so I can tell you how the weekend's going to go.
 
 Not only that, but I'm not going to have to disassemble and reassemble
the home theater system, the arrangement of which is a tricky and
ever-changing process. To that end, I've created a [Visio diagram of my
home theater
system](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C2CB832A5EC9B707!45398&authkey=!AEfJyhzxza_55p0&ithint=file%2cvsd)
complete with all of the connectors and wires that I'll have to have.
 
 Right now, my speaker wires are all over the place, running along the
walls and ceiling because I don't have the ability to actually wire them
into the walls. I'll be doing the wiring the right way in the new place,
so I've gotta plan for that. I ordered some connectors and adapters from
Bose today to accommodate the [Acoustimass
6](http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_PRODUCT_PAGE_EVENT&product=am6_surround_index&pageName=/home_entertainment/theater/systems/surround/index.jsp)
system I'm running (they have oddly shaped RCA connectors) and those
should be coming in a couple of weeks.
 
 I also want to get rid of these generally crappy cables I have and get
some high-end cables that are better quality and more easily managed. I
don't think that'll happen right off, but it'll be something to shoot
for.
