It's hot outside, the first day it's been really hot this year. I've got
my shorts on, I've got my t-shirt on, and I'm really not wanting to be
at work. Good thing I'm in training tomorrow and Thursday, then off
Friday.
 
 I got a free sneak-preview pass to go see [*The Italian
Job*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0317740) on Thursday. It's been a while
since I saw a movie in the theater, so it'll be good. And *free*, so it
meets my budgetary requirements.
 
 I forgot to mention that my sister was up from school in Utah this
weekend. She was picking up my parents' old car (since they got a new
one recently) and driving back to Utah with her friend. Of course, while
she was here she had an ear infection bad enough to rupture her eardrum,
so it wasn't the most pleasant of trips. Good to see her, though, and
I'm hoping she made it back safely.
 
 Work is keeping me well over busy with the amount of stuff I'm working
on. It'll be nice to get some of these larger projects done so I can
feel like I've accomplished something.
 
 I'm thinking about it, and I haven't heard from my friends Liz or
Douglas lately. I should probably email them.
