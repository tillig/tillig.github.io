I got my fourth Xbox (the results of [the third
repair](/archive/2007/09/21/on-to-xbox-360-number-four.aspx)) and
steeled myself for the hoop-jumping madness that is the digital rights
management system on Xbox Live.

In my [two](/archive/2006/08/10/xbox-live-arcade-got-drm-all-wrong.aspx)
[previous](/archive/2007/04/27/xbox-live-marketplace-still-has-drm-troubles.aspx)
bouts with this, the process has been basically:

1.  Create a brand new Xbox Live Silver account.
2.  Delete all your stuff.  Try to re-download it because that's
    supposed to re-authorize the console.  It doesn't work for me.
3.  Call in for "points after repair."  (Get codes from Microsoft
    that you can redeem for points.)
4.  Apply those points to the Xbox Live Silver account.
5.  Re-purchase and re-download all of your stuff.

They must have been getting people abusing the system (like getting the
points and buying different things) because the process has changed.  My
understanding of the new process is:

1.  Call in to get points after repair, as before.
2.  Explain to the new technician what you mean by "points after repair"
    and why you want it.  (For me, it's because my account can play the
    content still but it won't work for any other profiles on the
    machine unless I'm logged in, so my wife is screwed if I take my
    profile and go play at a friend's house.)
3.  The technician will ask you if you've tried deleting and
    re-downloading the content.  Try it and find that it doesn't work.
4.  The technician will escalate the call to a supervisor who will ask
    you if you've tried deleting and re-downloading the content. 
    Somehow the result of the earlier trial hasn't changed in the last
    three minutes.
5.  The supervisor will give you a new reference number and schedule a
    call for a few days hence to get a resolution.
6.  Before the scheduled call, another technician will call you and ask
    you if you've tried deleting and re-downloading the content. 
    Because they didn't, like, write that down or anything.  Explain the
    results of the previous attempt and that you're waiting for the
    call.  The technician will tell you to keep waiting for that
    scheduled call.
7.  The scheduled call occurs and the technician on the other end will
    ask you if you've tried deleting and re-downloading the content. 
    Sigh.
8.  The issue will be escalated again, this time to someone who
    supposedly can do something about it.  In two to four weeks, you'll
    get a call with a resolution.
9.  When you get the call, you'll delete all of your content and
    re-download it through the Xbox Live Marketplace tab, under the area
    called something like "Previously Downloaded Content."  The
    resolution is, basically, that someone flipped a bit in a database
    somewhere so that *this time* when you re-download, it will not just
    re-download but also re-authorize your console for the content.

I am not all the way through this process.  I am currently on step
eight, waiting my two-to-four weeks to get the call that says someone
flipped the bit and I can re-authorize my console.

I'm not sure the new process is better.  I can see that it would stop
the folks abusing the system, which I think is good, but I think it's
pretty crappy that I've gotta sit for weeks waiting for this to happen. 
There has *got* to be a better way.
