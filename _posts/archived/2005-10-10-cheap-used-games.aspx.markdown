I have a difficult time ponying up $50 for a new game without having
played it before, and renting games costs like $7.50 each, after which,
if you like it, you still have to come up with $50 to buy the thing.

 For those in my boat, check out [GameFly](http://www.gamefly.com/) -
it's like [NetFlix](http://www.netflix.com), but for games, and you can
buy their used games for cheap, cheap, cheap. I bought my copy of [*God
of War*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XL3BA/mhsvortex)
from them for $28 - with free shipping - and the cheapest I can find it
used is $40 right now. And I'm not even a GameFly member! If you are a
member, you can rent the game using your membership and they have a
"Keep It" price which is significantly less than the cost of the game
new (usually by about $10 at least). For the avid gamer, definitely
something to look at.
