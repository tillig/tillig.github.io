I finally wore out my original Rock Band drums last night:

![That shadow is a
dent.](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2ppidzg09_oRgDl9ttecMiZ8jne4tzhHEhG0NkIF5MoaKIIU6tBBUYTE1KV0F20yHBK9Kidzyhla0dbUMWqtgbAZAPjy0ThrCw_2O_CZv3z3I/20081029brokendrumpadek6.jpg?psid=1)

The shadow I circled in the picture above is actually a big dent in the
pad. The underlying plastic is broken and the only thing holding it
together is the rubber liner on top of the pad. Lame.

I'm seriously considering picking up the [Ion Drum
Rocker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GNMPLC?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001GNMPLC)
as a replacement since I've heard nothing but good about it, but I've
also heard I should try out the new *Guitar Hero: World Tour* drum kit
first. I have a party I'm going to in a couple of weeks where I'll have
a chance to try the GH drums, so I'll wait until then to make a
decision. Honestly, right now... those Ion drums are looking goooood.
