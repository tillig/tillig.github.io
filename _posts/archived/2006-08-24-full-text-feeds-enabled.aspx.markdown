I put a little time in hacking the ol' pMachine and I have full-text RSS
enabled now instead of the partial-text feed I was running. I've been
wanting to do that for a while, I just hadn't had the real inclination
to get it done.
 
 I still really want to change blog software, but I haven't yet found
what I would call a "great" blog package. I started down the road to
dasBlog, but from a developer extension standpoint... eh. I might
consider moving to Subtext, but I haven't really looked at it yet from a
source level.
 
 Of course, technically both of those totally beat out what I'm on right
now, but if I'm going to put in the effort to move, it's gotta be worth
my while.
