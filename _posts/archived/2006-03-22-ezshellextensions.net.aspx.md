After fighting shell extensions for my [Junction Shell
Extension](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx) project,
I know what a pain it is. I can only imagine that this Sky Software
"[EZShellExtensions.Net](http://www.ssware.com/ezshell/ezshell.htm)"
product will make that vastly easier. Of course, at $95 per developer,
I'm not sure if it fits my $0 software budget, but if I really got into
it, that might be the way to go.
