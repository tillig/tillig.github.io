Okay, folks, here are your million-dollar product ideas for April 2008.
If you implement these, remember to send me a t-shirt or something.

![Coffee should come in milk
cartons.](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2poaa59SUvBKRkJN8uVILpb0fK_aayEkAMm_nn0JNUNS3dK8VOg_mer-vilTFmUdX53oC0OBSlLvT3ZZxJhFoP70sVXuYgFJgruKzWsoEyy8c/20080402carton.jpg?psid=1)**Coffee
should come in milk cartons.** I can't really remember the last time I
actually measured coffee into the coffee maker. Once you've done it a
couple of times, you know that a mound of coffee about *this big* is the
equivalent of two scoops or whatever. But pouring coffee into the
machine out of a bag is, well, sometimes troublesome. You kind of have
to manually munge a "spout" on the end of the bag, too much comes out...
bah. Other containers - cans, tins, etc. - are also problematic. Put it
in a milk carton so I can pour it.

**Combine Dance Dance Revolution and Rock Band for the ultimate music
experience.**I think I have like six versions of
[DDR](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A09EL?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000A09EL)
at home. I know I have at least four dance pads across two different
consoles. I love DDR. I also love [Rock
Band](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TT4GBG?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000TT4GBG).
They should let you hook up more than four people in Rock Band. Keep the
four band members - guitar, bass, drums, vocals - but add the ability to
hook up dance pads. The vocalist could dance while singing, and
additional dance pads could be added for "backup dancers." Hey, if the
guitarist really wants to get crazy, dance while playing the guitar. You
could combine that with [the stage kit coming in
June](http://www.joystiq.com/2008/01/13/rock-band-stage-show-coming-to-gamestop-in-june/)
and have yourself a full production, ready to go on tour. I'd totally
buy it.
