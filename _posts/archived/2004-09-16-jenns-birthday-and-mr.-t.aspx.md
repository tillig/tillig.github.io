It's Jenn's birthday today, so happy birthday to her. Woohoo!

 ![Mr. T - In your
pocket!]({{ site.url }}/images/20040916mrt.jpg)While
crusing around the net on my usual rounds, I saw this bad boy. [Mr. T in
your pocket.](http://www.emerchandise.com/product/KCMRT0001/s.0rB3Ybdl)
It's just crazy enough that I may well have to buy it.

 (I haven't got it yet, but I'm seriously considering.)

 I mean, how can you pass up on the random "I pity the fool!" in the
middle of a serious business meeting? Is that not the ultimate
icebreaker?
