I went yesterday to [Magnolia A/V](http://www.magnoliahifi.com) and
picked out my new TV. I ended up getting the [Sharp Aquos
LC-37D7U](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007UVYLW/mhsvortex),
the latest 37" LCD panel. The repair people I talked to recommended the
Sharp line, and I've seen 'em in action and liked 'em, so this seemed
the best way to go.

 It arrives Monday morning, when the delivery folks will also take away
the old distort-o-vision. Apparently they're going to calibrate it and
whatnot and one of the store employees is going to buy it. More power to
him.

 The only downside now is I have to go out and get a new TV stand, which
I plan on doing today. Heck, if that's the only thing left to do, I'm
made in the shade.
