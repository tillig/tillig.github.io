It's been a few years since I've upgraded the ol' PC and I'm thinking
the next time I do it, I will probably get a laptop. I don't generally
upgrade individual components on my machine - lack of time, money, and
energy, you see - and it'd be nice to be able to sit in the living room
and watch a little TV or whatever while I'm answering emails and such.

 I found the laptop I need this morning:

 ![Is this Dr. Evil's
laptop?](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pZqKxn2qHasMERUYyS8Rp_P6RgGZIHUjkqZ0ZU5klAvi2RV4-HyfKylC1E8WrRFj2w5UhQELTy7ZlgADkSiEJs9qU3DufVHsqY8JmQfAx90Y/20070112secretlaptopmr9.png?psid=1)

 I'm *all about* the giant button and arbitrary LED readout. Oh *hell
yes*. Pair this with [the self destruction button USB
hub](http://www.geekstuff4u.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&products_id=404)
and you're *gooooooooooold*.
