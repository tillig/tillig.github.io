I'm sure I'm the last person even finding this bandwagon to jump on, but
this has to be the coolest thing since cool things:
[pInvoke.net](http://www.pinvoke.net/) and its associated [VS.NET
plugin](http://www.gotdotnet.com/Community/UserSamples/Details.aspx?SampleGuid=75122f62-5459-4364-b9ba-7b5e6a4754fe).
 
 Because there's no reason to learn C++ if you don't have to.
