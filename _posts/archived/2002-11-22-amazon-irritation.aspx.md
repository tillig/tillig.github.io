Okay, I'm irritated with [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com).

 A while back I made a purchase using primarily gift certificates. It
cost me near $150 for everything, but $110 of it was covered by gift
certificates I'd saved up. When the package shipped, Amazon billed me
$140 - only $10 of the gift certificates cleared, the other $100
didn't.

 I contacted Amazon and they said that the other $100 hadn't cleared
due to a "technical problem." The issue was fixed and I would see a
refund on my credit card shortly, accompanied by an email telling me
that they'd processed the refund.

 I waited for around 10 days and still hadn't seen the refund, so I
contacted them again. This time they said they were still working on it,
that refunds take 7 - 10 business days, and that I would definitely get
an email telling me when the refund occurred. That was Monday the 18th.

 I went to look at my credit card statement today online and I saw that
I had received a refund from Amazon, dated 11/19... for $89. Where's
the other $11? (Of course, I never did get an email from them, so maybe
they're somehow processing a $100 refund in two blocks - one for $89
and one for $11? Yeah, I didn't think so, either.)

 I've sent them another note. [I want my
$11!](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKFA/mhsvortex)
