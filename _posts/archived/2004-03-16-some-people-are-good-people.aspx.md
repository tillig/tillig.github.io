I wrote yesterday about some eBay troubles I was having where an item I
sent to someone in Australia got shipped to the wrong person.

 I contacted the person who got the shirt and asked them what we could
do to get the issue resolved and got back the following:

 I wrote back to the guy and thanked him for doing that. I got:

 I figure it's beside the point that I used the address I was given by
the customer. It's stuff like this that sort of restores my faith in
humanity. Some people out there *are* good.
