I've heard some whiny people complaining about how it's hard to remember
my domain name, so to make it easier I've registered some domains that
will redirect you here:
 
 **travisillig.com**
 **travisillig.net**
 **travisillig.org**
 
 So hitting [http://www.travisillig.com](http://www.travisillig.com)
should redirect you to [http://www.paraesthesia.com](/). I even
registered the .net and .org domains so *you don't have to remember the
extension*, you lazy bums. All you have to do is remember my name, and
**\*bam\*** you're here.
 
 (I wanted "illig.com" but it's some punk clothing manufacturer... and
"tillig.com" is a model train company... so you get the full name.)
