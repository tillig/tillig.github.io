Well, it seems thus far that the move to blogging has been fairly well
accepted by the populace. I'm pretty stoked with it myself. Look, ma!
I'm updating my site! *Regularly!*
 
 As far as the major [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) pimping that's
taking place here... hey, it never hurts to make a little money on the
side. Besides, if I'm diligent enough to keep up with it, you may see a
link to something cool that you may just "have to have." I buy
everything from Amazon, you may as well give in and do it, too.
