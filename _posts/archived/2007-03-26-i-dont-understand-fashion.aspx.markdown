I'm not a high-fashion guy. I don't get the whole avant-garde fashion
thing, I don't follow trends, and I'm not paying $300 for a shirt. That
said, I know what I like, and what I like generally tends towards what I
guess could be considered "simple classics." I generally stick to the
Ralph Lauren area in the store because I can't deal with the unkempt
"thug" look they try to sell me in the juniors and I'm not going to wear
the golf pants they try to sell me in the "adult" section. I have an
even more particular taste with what I find attractive in women's
clothing - IMHO, a simple black dress will beat out some crazy,
extravagant number any day. With that in mind...

 Jenn and I went shopping at Macy's on Saturday. I was thinking about
getting a new shirt or two and she just wanted to see what's new for the
season. When we walked in, though, I really felt like I was caught in
some sort of time warp. It was the 70's meets the 80's with a touch of
60's thrown in for good measure. All of the colors were muted browns,
greens, and oranges like you see in pictures from the 70's. The dresses
all looked either like something you'd need to wear gogo boots with or
like something that might go great with some stirrup pants underneath.
Patterns were big, blocky, and geometric - they gave me a headache just
looking at them.

 I started feeling like I was listening to an orchestra perpetually
tuning up. Everything was dischord and no notes stood out whatsoever.
Every color on every garment was flat - not quite red, but not quite
orange and not really yellow, either. It seemed like the aim was for a
sort of *haute couture jazz* to emerge from the noise, but I wasn't
hearing it.

 In the end, I didn't find anything I liked (the stock seemed to be sort
of between-seasons; I don't need a bulky sweater, but I'm not looking
for an unimpressive standard button-up shirt, either) and Jenn came out
with a pair of pants and a dress that look great on her and did their
best to separate themselves from the visual onslaught on the racks.
Here's hoping they snap out of it soon.
