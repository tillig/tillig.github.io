Cabin fever has officially set in (seems I'm not the only one -
[Greg](http://www.greghughes.net)'s had it, too). I'm working at home -
again - and not having set foot outside the apartment for the fourth day
in a row is working its desctruction on me. Jenn was able to make it to
the corner store last night - barely - to get us some food, but the
store was entirely out of eggs and almost out of milk, so they're
screwed, too, being without stock.

 Overnight everything iced up again and while I feel like I should just
go into work for the social bit of it, I'm sitting in my dining room
right now watching someone who's stuck in the apartment complex parking
lot spinning their wheels on the ice... no thanks. They're not even
running busses around here. No way can I make it to work.

 I've added a new category - Geek Moments - to start handling the
tech-related postings I have. I've already posted one today about the
new features in ASP.NET. Woohoo!

 Well, I should actually get some work done. Some time around midday I'm
going to call Comcast and get my damn cable modem thing going. I can't
be having this dial up thing anymore.
