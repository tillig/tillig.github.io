Screw that whole "Stairway to Heaven" thing, man. It's all about Ozzy's
"No More Tears."

 Bought a 32" TV from a friend of mine at work and, with help from
another friend, got it up the stairs into my game room. (I seem to be
doing a lot of television related operations lately, don't I?) Went to
the store after work and, with the measurements of the TV from the TV's
manual, I picked out an entertainment center (corner unit) to put the
thing on because the one we already had in the game room wasn't big
enough (or weight-bearing enough).

 It's pretty cool. It's got the base with a couple of shelves under it
that you can put components on, then a couple of shelves that sit above
the TV you can put CDs or whatever on. The box said "fits most 32-inch
TVs," which is what I bought, and the measurements were right. Fine.

 Got the thing home, put it together, and, with Jenn's help got the TV
up there.

 TOO SMALL. Well, technically the right size, but the TV's more
front-heavy than anything and was sitting there sort of precariously. If
the cat jumped on it, it'd all be over.

 Well, can't take it back now, and I don't have anywhere else to put the
TV, so....

 ...unscrew the top part (with the shelves and the CD rack and all that)
so we can push the TV back a bit (so the back of the TV hangs over the
back of the stand) and... presto! Sits perfectly.

 Of course, now I've got the top half of a corner entertainment unit
that I have no idea what to do with.

 But it looks great!

 Lots to try and get done this weekend. I want to adjust my awning so
the motor doesn't try to over-extend the awning when it rolls out. I
also want to get the cord mounted so we can just leave it plugged in.

 I had a dream last night that I was in this Disneyland-style theme park
and had lost my
[ushanka](http://www.russianlegacy.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=32_45_147&products_id=1694).
There were all sorts of them on the ground, there were vendors selling
them... but none of them were mine. I went to the lost and found, right
near the skee-ball game, but they didn't have my hat, either. Never did
find it again.
