I've been living up the
[*Amplitude*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000859TM/mhsvortex),
and I'm finding that the more I play, the better I get (as you would
hope but not necessarily expect). It being a musical game and me with
[what I would like to think is] a decent sense of rhythm, the only real
thing you have to figure out is how to get your fingers to move in the
appropriate pattern.

 Jenn was watching me last night as I was going through a pretty complex
set of tracks and was saying that she didn't think her brain could work
that fast. That's when I realized the key to the game: You can't *think*
about what you're doing, you just have to *do* it. If you take the time
to analyze and cogitate the pattern, you've already taken too long and
you're done. I guess it's sort of like any other inherent sort of
talent, kind of like riding a bike - you don't think, "Okay, now I
balance this way, now I step on this pedal..." You just *ride the bike*.
I think that's one of the things I like best about the game - no
analysis, just raw action.
