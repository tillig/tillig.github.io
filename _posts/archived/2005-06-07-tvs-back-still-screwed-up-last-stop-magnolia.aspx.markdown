The TV got returned to me at 11:00a today, still exhibiting the
discoloration and distorted picture they took it away to repair all that
time ago. They replaced the tube - it's still there. Of course, *now*
they claim it's "factory spec."
 
 Interestingly enough, I requested documentation twice from the repair
shop that showed my TV being within factory spec parameters. What I got
back was a rather unhelpful invoice with my original problem description
on it and any cost-oriented information blacked out and an equally
unhelpful email saying, "The set is within factory specifications. You
may contact Sony for those numbers. I asure you that all numbers are
well within the ranges."
 
 That's... that's *great*.
 
 Since the warranty company won't help me because the repair shop says
it's factory spec, and the repair shop won't budge on its determination
of factory spec, my last ditch effort is to contact [Magnolia
A/V](http://www.magnoliahifi.com) (where I purchased the set) and see if
they will help me from a dissatisfied customer standpoint.
 
 So far, I haven't been disappointed. I spoke with the store manager on
the phone and he promptly contacted their regional service manager, who,
in turn, is going to contact the repair shop that "fixed" my set and
find out their story. The regional service manager is then going to call
me back tomorrow and talk to me about... something. Next steps? Tell me
I'm screwed? Something.
 
 This is pretty much my last avenue, short of small claims court (which
is just going to cost the same as it would if I bought a new TV anyway)
or filing formal complaints (which still leaves me a TV short).
 
 A final, interesting note: When the repair shop guys delivered my set,
they were curious why I wasn't putting the set in the garage. They were
under the impression the set was going to be switched out for a new one.
I told them the story of how it's now "factory spec" and they agreed
that was a pretty fishy situation. Hmmm. Even the delivery folks from
the repair company think it's weird.
