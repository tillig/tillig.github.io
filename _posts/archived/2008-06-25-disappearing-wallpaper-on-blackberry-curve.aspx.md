I finally got around to putting a new picture as the home screen image
on my new BlackBerry Curve. The problem - every time I synchronized
against the BlackBerry Desktop Manager software, my home screen image
would get reset to the default for the theme. I'd go set it again, sync
up, and watch my wallpaper disappear. The image file was still there, it
just wasn't my wallpaper anymore.

The answer: **Store any picture you want as your home screen image on
the device memory, not on a media card.** If you store the image on the
media card, it'll get reset when you sync. If you store it on the device
memory, it's stays persistent the way you'd expect.
