Not quite a month ago, I bought an [HP C7280
All-in-One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UY6M2G?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000UY6M2G)
scanner/fax/copier/printer over at the [Buy
More](http://www.bestbuy.com). I chose an all-in-one because my desk at
home was starting to look like a dot-com-startup server room with all of
the various pieces of equipment crowding around. The printer died and I
sort of wanted to upgrade from my old HP ScanJet 5P (SCSI-based)
scanner, so I figured now was the time.

Got it home and it printed beautifully. Like, even on "normal" quality,
the print output really was gorgeous. Put a 5" x 7" photo on it and did
a photo reprint at 4" x 6" and it not only perfectly scaled the photo
down but did a borderless reprint on photo paper that looked as good as
the original. Very impressed. To top it off, it was connected entirely
via ethernet, so I didn't have to have a print server or anything
sharing the printer so the laptop could access.

It was about a week after I had it before I tried to do a scan - a CD
album cover so I could attach the album art in iTunes.

***Horrible.*** Like, really horrible.

Here's a snippet of the *Juno* soundtrack cover. When you look at the
cover with the naked eye, it looks nice, crisp, smooth. The edges of the
orange stripes are sharp. The light gray shading is a solid color. The
letters, while done with a hand-drawn style, have hard edges. Not at all
how the scan comes out.

cover.]({{ site.url }}/images/20080411badscan.jpg)

Look at the scan - the edges of the orange stripes are actually fuzzy.
There's pixelation, almost like a halftone, in the gray shading. The
edge of the "J" there looks like it was drawn with a dull colored
pencil, which isn't even close to the way the cover actually looks.

This is how every scan turned out. Colors that appear solid on paper
become spotty. I had one weird instance where I scanned a large area of
solid blue and the scan came out with Moire patterns in it. To add to
the weirdness, this only really happened with printed materials. If I
scanned a photo, it would come out decent.

I tried different resolutions, different color depths, different
sharpness settings, different color/brightness settings, different OSes
(Vista and XP), different scanning programs, different versions of the
drivers... no luck.

I spent two weeks going back and forth with HP support on it and they
claim (rightly so) that since copies looked good, there was nothing
wrong with the hardware. We then spent literally hours uninstalling and
reinstalling drivers, adding and removing HP bloatware... all to no
avail. I'm about three days away from my 30 day return limit and I'm
taking it back tonight.

I'll be looking at Canon or Epson. Sorry, HP. I'm done.
