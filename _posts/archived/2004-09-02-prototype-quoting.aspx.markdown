Looks like I'm [getting quoted over at Hanselman's
site](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b82d92bd-66da-4660-9341-b043fde57c0b).
Go check out [this article on the Laws of Prototypes at Tim Weaver's
site](http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/tim.weaver/archive/2004/09/01/23928.aspx)
and tell me I'm wrong when I say the guy hit the nail on the head. I
couldn't have said it better myself.
