eCoustics has [a great article on
HDTV](http://forum.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/34579/284986.html) that
explains everything you ever wanted to know, including whether 1080p is
something you should step up to. Given the human eye's limitations, you
may not actually be able to distinguish a 720p from 1080p broadcast,
pending on how far away from the TV you sit. This is a good complement
to [the *Hanselminutes* episode on
HDTV](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=46).

 I have a 37" LCD screen that displays at 1366 x 768, effectively
limiting me to 720p (upscaled, or 1080p downscaled). Unless I sit 4.8
feet from the screen, I probably won't really notice the difference
between 720p and 1080p display.

 Now I'm going to have to go home and measure to see how far we are from
the TV.
