Now that this [*Kingdom
Hearts*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066TS5/mhsvortex)
thing has invaded our lives, it's become sort of an obsession. I believe
Jenn is starting to understand the conversion of a game from a pastime
to an addiction, just as I understood when I first encountered [*Grand
Theft Auto 3*](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/). It's no
longer just something to sit down and play; it's a common reference
point that we can share and see what's going on with the other person's
game.
 
 Jenn's a bit further ahead than I am as far as her characters are
concerned, but I've taken more time to go through each world you must
traverse and get all of the things so I don't have to go back.
 
 A few nights ago we watched *A Very Merry Muppet Christmas* on NBC and
were very pleased with it. We had just recently been complaining about
how Kermit the Frog really doesn't sound like Kermit now that Jim
Henson's dead, and with this latest movie, I was pleased that his voice
was nearly spot-on. They also paid a lot of tribute to the original
Muppet movies and had some great humor for both the kids and the
adults.
 
 I ended up buying the VHS tape (along with a "Best of Muppets CD") from
[ShopNBC.com](http://www.shopnbc.com/famdetail.asp?familyid=N60242&track=-15001&storenum=2).
Normally I would never consider buying a VHS tape in my land of DVDs,
but I asked the customer service folks and they said they weren't going
to release it on DVD. Anyway, I look forward to that getting here so I
can see it again. Great stuff.
 
 Hmmm... Oh - I get the [Zamboni](http://www.zamboni.com) newsletter
(what - don't *you*?) and saw in this latest one that they're coming out
with a remote controlled Zamboni ice resurfacing machine. I think that's
a must-have for yours truly. Jenn's dad has a remote controlled truck,
my dad has a Hum-Vee... I need the Zamboni. (Speaking of Zamboni, a lot
of their clothing items are on sale. For those looking for gifts for
Trav, there you go...)
 
 I've started reading a book called [*The Golden Compass* by Philip
Pullman](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345413350/mhsvortex).
It reads a little like the *Harry Potter* series, but has a much
different world; rather than placing magic into today's world like
*Harry Potter* does, this series takes place in a world where you might
recognize the names of things, but that's about as far as it gets. Sort
of alternate universe style. Anyway, it's really quite good so far,
though I'm only on page 50 or thereabouts, so [you don't have to take my
word for it](http://gpn.unl.edu/rainbow/).
 
 Finally, I'm in the process of installing and testing [SharePoint
Portal Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/portalserver.asp) v2
beta 1. After talking to the Microsoft guys about it, it looks like a
lot of the work I've done on customizing v1 over the past year will
basically amount to [*jack
squat*](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/92/92smattfoley.phtml) because
they're changing the whole thing so drastically. On one side, I'm happy
that they've improved everything so greatly; on the other, I can't help
but feel like I've basically just been spinning my wheels for the past
year now because I've gotta start all over from scratch - there's no
"migration path" for these things. C'est la vie.
