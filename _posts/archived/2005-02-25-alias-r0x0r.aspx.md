![Jennifer
Garner]({{ site.url }}/images/20050225jgarner.jpg)I'm
wearing my new [*Alias*
t-shirt](http://abctvstore.shopthescene.com/detail.php?p=1680),
listening to the [*Alias* Season
1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000TAZ88/mhsvortex) and
[*Alias* Season
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00065JTBK/mhsvortex)
soundtracks... Watched *Alias* on Wednesday and am liking that they're
getting back into some of the more intriguing plotlines (rather than
turning into a new version of *Mission: Impossible*)...

 Loving it. [*Alias*](http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/index.html)
rules.
