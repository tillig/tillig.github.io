Saw a preview for a new CBS show called *[Kid
Nation](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/kid_nation/)* last night.  The idea
is that they set 40 kids up in an old west town with no adults around
and see how they fare.

Anyone else think this sounds like *[Lord of the
Flies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140283331?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140283331)*,
western style?  I'm waiting for the part where Piggy gets killed *on
national television*.

Yeah, they'll probably edit that out.
