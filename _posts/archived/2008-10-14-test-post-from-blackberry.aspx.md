Just downloaded a MetaWeblogAPI blog client for Blackberry. Here's
hoping it works!

**UPDATE**: Either the client sucks or there's some oddness with the
MetaWeblogAPI implementation in my version of Subtext. Either way, not
good. Maybe this is my opportunity to learn Blackberry development.
Until then, Opera Mini to the rescue!
