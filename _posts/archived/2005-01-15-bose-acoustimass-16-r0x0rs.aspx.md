I got the [Bose Acoustimass
16](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006L7RX/mhsvortex) setup
running and let me tell you:
 
 It is absolutely fucking amazing.
 
 I had the [Acoustimass 6
series](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005T3RO/mhsvortex)
running before - passive subwoofer, five single-cube satellite speakers.
Loved it. This new set has an active sub and six double-cube satellite
speakers.
 
 I thought my old system was great, but this blows it out of the water.
It's like gold plating the gold I already had. I've been watching movies
and stuff all day and I don't think I'm going to leave the living room
ever again.
 
 The only downside is that my amp doesn't do 6.1 surround, only 5.1, so
the center-rear channel isn't hooked up. Guess it's time to upgrade that
amplifier, eh?
