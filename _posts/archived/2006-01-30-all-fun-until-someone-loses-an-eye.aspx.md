Friday night Jenn and I went over to my parents' place to watch [*Mr.
and Mrs.
Smith*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP04FG/mhsvortex)
(they hadn't seen it yet) and to pick up the [fourth season of
*MacGyver*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BDGWD0/mhsvortex),
which my mom got me.

 The plan was originally to have [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net)
come over on Saturday and have a *MacGyver* marathon. Something came up
and he wasn't able to make it, but we all got together Saturday night at
Stu and Tiff's place to have some dinner (Stu made some tasty herb
chicken and potatoes) and play games. The game of choice that night was
*Weapons and Warriors*.

 In this game, each team (Jenn and I, Stu and Tiff) sets up a castle
that has all sorts of breakaway features (the windows break out,
ramparts come off, etc.). Each person has a crossbow, catapult, or
cannon that shoots these little red balls. The object is to shoot down
the other team's castle (actually, it's to knock down the *guys* in the
other team's castle, but the goal is effectively the same).

 I really don't know if they should sell stuff like that to little kids.
The whole thing got totally out of control - little red cannonballs
flying everywhere, people getting shot in the neck (thanks, Tiff!)...
and the castles (in some cases) are really too sturdy so it's hard to
knock them down from across the room. After one round, I went over to
Stu and Tiff's castle and had a rough time breaking one of the ramparts
off by pushing on it *with my finger*.

 Anyway, like I said, out of control. Tiff ended up finding one of the
cannonballs in her school bag on Sunday when she went to her study
group. Out of control, and *far* too much fun. Next time I might have to
take some protective eyewear.

 Sunday was the *MacGyver* marathon. Stu came over and we popped [season
four](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BDGWD0/mhsvortex) in.
Apart from stopping to go get some pizza and soda, we made it nine
episodes in before calling it a night. Tiff ended up joining us toward
the end, and Jenn made some awesome Indian food from this cookbook we
got a while ago (so the last episode was spent on the leading edge of a
food coma).

 All in all, a super successful weekend. Onward, to the week!
