I should probably add this to my [Interaction
Preferences](/archive/2006/03/30/my-interaction-preferences.aspx) entry,
but I'll throw it in here for now.
 
 In the last week or so I've been running across some particular email
things I *absolutely hate*:

-   **Don't send me an email and then show up before the email arrives
    in my inbox to discuss the contents of that email.** Give me at
    least 15 minutes to receive, read, and digest what you've sent
    before incurring further conversation on it.
-   **Don't send me an email with half of your response then come tell
    me the other half in person.** Send me the whole response - with all
    of the required details and context - so I don't have to mentally
    assemble the complete response and somehow get that filed for later
    reference.
