![Trav and Jenn on "Speed: The
Ride"](https://hyqi8g.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2p_v1S13A1pm8VByqY_Rqi_8Xeq0Ml4mhGwxacIcWziBEo0fzsGM_bbdwiq_36NHANLE8ngj5f8NiCnNzzY9dOXPV9A8oJsEV5_bnc3ENCYMU/20071030speedride.jpg?psid=1)Last
week, my parents, Jenn, and I all packed up and headed down to Vegas for
three days.

I've been to Las Vegas a bajillion times now but it's always different
and there's always something new and fun to check out, so I love heading
down there.  (Granted, it's a little hot for my taste, so while it's a
nice place to visit, it'd take a lot for me to want to actually move
there.)

We stayed at the MGM Grand and the night we got there we went to
[KA](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/Cirquedusoleil/ka/).  It's the second
time I've seen that show, but it was just as spectacular as the first. 
Once again, front row center tickets, and well worth the price of
admission.

We took full advantage of the [Las Vegas
Monorail](http://www.lvmonorail.com/), even having a stop right at our
hotel.  If you head down there, you'll find the \$9 day ticket well
worth the money.  Of course, that didn't stop us from walking our asses
off and getting all grumpy because of the overall pain of
one-foot-in-front-of-the-other.  At the end of the second day, we were
just about dead and Dad just had to go to one last tchotchke shop to
pick up this ridiculous tiny "Las Vegas" sign that, as it turns out,
they sold at the gift store at our hotel.

On the other hand, how can you pass up a trip to go shit shopping at the
[World's Largest Gift Shop](http://www.worldslargestgiftshop.com)?  You
can't say no.  You just can't.  Even though it's sort of like seeing all
of the stupid tourist traps at the beach all in one big building.

While we were down at that end of the strip, we stopped in at [The
Sahara](http://www.saharavegas.com/) and rode "[Speed: The
Ride](http://www.nascarcafelasvegas.com/speed.php)."  It's a roller
coaster only 40 seconds long, but it's a hell of a 40 seconds and worth
the \$10 to ride.  Jenn, Dad, and I rode that and got off the train all
weak-legged and wobbly.  Good times.

After all was said and done, we got back home safe and sound, ready for
another trip down there.  I think we might go again in February for my
friend Adam's birthday.  We'll have to see.

To close - a picture of me and my parents outside the Treasure Island:
