I'm going to do a lot of very small personal updates all in one fell
swoop. Here we go!

-   **Got**[**laser hair removal treatment
    \#11**](/archive/2008/04/07/laser-hair-removal-treatment-9.aspx)**on
    my face on Saturday morning.** They recalibrated the laser and
    replaced the diode in it, so it was more powerful than before. They
    had to take it down a couple of notches. Results are still looking
    good and my chin is still the stubborn part. I wasn't allowed to
    shave at all on Sunday morning (to let my face recoup) so by Sunday
    you could really see how patchy I am. Next time is the last in my
    latest pack of six, so I'll probably be getting another pack.
    Hopefully by the end of 18 I'll have things pretty well cleared out.
    We've had quite a bit of decent progress in this last set of six.
-   **Did fireworks for the**[**Reed
    College**](http://www.reed.edu/)**alumni reunion Saturday night.**
    Jenn and I have our state pyrotechnician licenses up for renewal,
    but since [last fourth of July we did the Walla Walla, WA
    show](/archive/2007/07/06/walla-walla-fireworks-2007.aspx) it
    doesn't count towards our Oregon license renewal requirements. Doing
    this show made up for that and we can now get renewed. Since we're
    doing Walla Walla again this year, we'll have to do another make-up
    show. Hopefully we can get an Oregon show next year so it counts
    towards the licenses.
-   **I beat *[Professor Layton and the Curious
    Village](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U5W3IW?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000U5W3IW)*
    on Sunday.** Jenn got this game for her Nintendo DS a few weeks ago
    and I tried it out, quickly becoming addicted. The puzzles are
    great, many of them classic programming puzzles. We woke up tired
    Sunday morning and I flipped on the DS... and suddenly it was three
    hours later and I had finally beat the game. A great game, highly
    recommended. Looks like there's going to be a sequel, too, which I
    look forward to.
-   **This morning, my Outlook calendar disappeared.** I fired up
    Outlook this morning and it informed me that "Outlook closed
    improperly last time" and that there were "some errors." Looking at
    my calendar, nothing was on it. I quickly went to the webmail view
    of Outlook and all my stuff was still there, so it was a problem
    with my local profile. I've deleted and recreated my profile locally
    but... well, I started getting a lot of unfortunate behavior from
    other Office apps. Turns out there were some security patches pushed
    this weekend that I got when I booted up this morning. Other people
    are seeing unfortunate behavior as well. So, after fighting with
    delete/recreate for some time, I'm doing the full Office reinstall.
    This won't take any time *at all*.
