I was sitting here, minding my own, when the alarm went off for a fire
drill.
 
 Normally fire drills take place on a nice sunny day, so it's not a big
deal - you quickly pack up your stuff (because who knows how long you're
going to be outside, plus you want to make sure if it's a real fire that
your iPod won't be burning) and follow the herd to whatever arbitrary
meeting spot you're supposed to be at. That's generally followed up by
some milling about, laughing about the inconvenience of it all and
wondering how much money is actually being spent on the drill due to
lost productivity.
 
 Today's drill started out the same, packing everything up and following
the crowd, but the wrench in the works is that it was pouring rain
outside, so everyone was outside shivering and getting soaked through to
the bone. In a word, it sucked. Plus the lost time. I'm totally wet now,
sitting here trying to re-focus on what I was working on, and, frankly,
it's just not happening. Maybe I need to head into the bathroom and dry
off with some paper towels.
