My first ever sale on eBay happened yesterday around 5:30p, just six
hours after I relisted. Apparently it's true - people don't want 10
shirts all at once, they want one shirt at a time, and they'll pay more
per shirt to buy individually. Score!
 
 Now I just need to get my ass to the Office Depot to pick up some
envelopes to mail these things in. I have a scale at home that'll weigh
up to five pounds (it's a kitchen scale, but that's okay) so I'll be
able to calculate and print shipping at home from the USPS site (as long
as delivery confirmation is good enough; I have to go to the post office
if the person wants insurance).
