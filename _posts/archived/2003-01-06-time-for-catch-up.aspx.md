Well, folks, I'm back in the office and playing catch-up on all the
exciting things I missed over the holiday break I just took. Looks like
I've got 173 new messages in my personal inbox and 122 in my work inbox.
After I check those out and take the appropriate action on each, I'll
see about posting the happenings from the vacation.
