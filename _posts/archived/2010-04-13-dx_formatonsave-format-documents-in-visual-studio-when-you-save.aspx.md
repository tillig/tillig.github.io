Visual Studio allows you to specify different code formatting rules for
different languages it understands, but in many cases the formatting
only applies to new code you're writing. For example, C# lines
generally get formatted when you hit the end of the line and type the
semicolon... but the only line that gets formatted is the one you just
completed.

Wouldn't it be nice if the whole document would adhere to the same
formatting without you having to pay attention to it?

[With this
plugin](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/wiki/DX_FormatOnSave),
you can automatically have Visual Studio apply code formatting to the
entire document you're working on when you save. That way you don't have
to think about it - your documents will always be formatted.

(You used to be able to do this [in VS2008 using
PowerCommands](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands), but that
doesn't exist for VS2010 and this way you don't need to install
PowerCommands just for the one functionality.)

You also have the ability to choose which types of documents you want
formatted on save:
