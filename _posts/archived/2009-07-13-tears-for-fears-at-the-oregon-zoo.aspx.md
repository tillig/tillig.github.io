![Tears for Fears performs at the Oregon
Zoo]({{ site.url }}/images/20090713tearsforfears.jpg)Saturday
evening Jenn and I went to the Oregon Zoo to catch the Tears for Fears
concert. I gotta say, it was awesome. Hearing the hits played live was
so cool - the crowd singing along to "Head Over Heels," dancing to
"Shout," and getting back to the *original* "Mad World" was not to be
missed.

[Michael Wainwright](http://www.myspace.com/wainwright) opened, played a
nice set, and then joined Tears for Fears to round out vocals. He was a
great "Woman In Chains," I have to say. :)

The weather was totally agreeable - nice and sunny, in contrast to [our
B-52s outing](/archive/2009/06/22/the-b-52s-at-the-oregon-zoo.aspx). We
kicked back, relaxed, ate an elephant ear, and took in the music. If you
get a chance, see these guys live. If they come back, I'm there.
