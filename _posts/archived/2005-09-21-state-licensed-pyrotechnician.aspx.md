![General Operator Certification for Public Display of
Fireworks]({{ site.url }}/images/20050921pyropermit.jpg)
 I noticed a couple of envelopes from the Office of Homeland Security
came in the mail today, which could mean only one thing: my
pyrotechnician license finally arrived.

 After a few years of working on shows for [Western Display
Fireworks](http://www.westerndisplay.com/) (usually with
[Greg](http://www.greghughes.net) running the show), Jenn and I both
took the pyro certification test, completed the prerequisites, and
applied for our Oregon state pyro licenses. It took a while (notice the
issue date is 8/4 but I just got it in the mail today), but it's finally
here.

 Technically, that means we can legally buy professional fireworks and
run our own show. Of course, there's a heck of a lot more to it than
just declaring you want to "have a show," and I'm really not ready to
take on that responsibility, so I don't think that'll be happening. But
we're *could*, and isn't that what matters? (I think we'll stick to
working with Western. Heh.)
