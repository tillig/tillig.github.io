The weekend was pretty good (of course, it's Tuesday and I'm just now
getting to write about it... tells you how the week is going so far).

 Saturday [we went out with Stu and
Tiff](http://www.stuartthompson.net/Blog/PermaLink,guid,34e191a3-d485-4367-bf99-7b0031bca91c.aspx)
to the local fun center and played laser tag, some video games, and my
personal favorite - [skee-ball](http://www.skeeball.com/).

 Sunday was the last hockey game of the season, so it was nice to see
the [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) pull that one off. 36
home games per season, and I'm hockeyed out. I'll be ready to go for
next season, but for now... I'm valuing the free time I'm suddenly
provided.

 I've been playing some more *[Katamari
Damacy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002Y2XXQ/mhsvortex)*
and I'm really getting into it. I was going to order the soundtrack
because it's really crazy (yet addictive) Japanese pop sort of music,
but it's like $30 everywhere. Thanks, but it's not worth $30 for the
novelty. Instead, I found [a guy who's got it for
download](http://www.frakarme.com/downloads.html) and picked it up
there. Love it. I'm listening right now.

 I'm still working on my pMachine to dasBlog conversion utility. I'm
trying to make it reasonably general-purpose, but I'm not sure how
successful that will be. When I'm done, I'll probably stick it up here
for "use at your own risk" usage. I was trying to make the code all nice
and documented and everything... but for a utility I'm only using once,
I may not go that far.
