I just got a copy of [*Professional ASP.NET
2.0*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764576100/mhsvortex) and
now I'm thinking it's time to put some of the skills I'll be learning
from it to use. [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and I have talked
about writing our own blog software because none of the packages out
there really do all the things we want, so maybe this is the time to
step up and learn this stuff. It's always better to learn when you have
a project you're working on (otherwise it's just aimless and nothing
seems to get done).

 Time to start reading, eh?
