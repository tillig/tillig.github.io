I started feeling the onset of getting sick toward the end of last week,
but it wasn't really bothering me until Friday night when I started
getting a pretty fierce fever. By Saturday morning, I had a full blown
case of whatever has been going around work the last few weeks. Upper
respiratory issues, stuffy head, fever, headache... ugh.

I spent Saturday in bed most of the day, and barely upright on the couch
the rest of the day. Sunday was only different in the proportion of
bed-time to couch-time: I made it out of bed a little earlier. I didn't
even really do much but watch TV. I tried to play some video games but
my need to shut my eyes every few minutes sort of blew that out of the
water and having to track all that movement on the screen made my head
hurt.

I went to the doctor on Monday and told him all my symptoms.

**Me**: ...fever, too. And I've got this headache behind my right eye
that sort of hurts if I -
 **Dr**: Let me see your glasses.
 **Me**: [Handing over my glasses...] My prescription hasn't really
changed in years. I just had my eyes checked in -
 **Dr**: They're crooked.
 **Me**: My glasses?
 **Dr:** Yeah, they're crooked. See how this arm isn't straight and the
lenses aren't even?
 **Me**: Oh, wow, yeah... I didn't even notice that. I wonder how long
it's been. Would that cause my headache?
 **Dr:** No, but it makes you look funny. Take those in and get 'em
fixed.

So, you can see, that was helpful. Actually, he confessed that there
really wasn't much they could do for what I've got, that it's common,
and basically I just get to wait it out. I got some Tylenol with Codeine
to manage my cough and was sent on my way.

I felt a lot better Tuesday - no fever, not much cough - but worked from
home to ensure I wasn't bringing this thing back to work to perpetuate
the vicious cycle.

I'm feeling way better even today, but my back is sore from sitting on
my not-remotely-ergonomic couch all day yesterday so I'm glad to be in
my chair... even though my work chair is also not really my favorite.
Looking forward to getting rid of this cough - it's getting old.
