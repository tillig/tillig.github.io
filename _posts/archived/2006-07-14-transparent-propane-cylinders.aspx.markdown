Ever wonder how much propane you have left for your barbecue? We have
this pressure gauge thing that mostly works to let us know, but these
new transparent propane cylinders have been a long time coming. [I have
to have one.](http://litecylinder.com/)
 
 Update: Looks like they're between \$80-100. You can get one
[here](http://www.propaneproducts.com/lite-cylinder.html) or
