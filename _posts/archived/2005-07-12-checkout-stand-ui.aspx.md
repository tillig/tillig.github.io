I work a lot at the UI layer of an application, so when I see bad UI, I
generally recognize it.

 I encountered bad UI as I was going through the self-checkout line of
the grocery store at lunch. I finished scanning all of my items, then
clicked the button to pay. The next screen showed me probably 20
different payment options, and some of them were redundant. In my case,
I wanted to pay with a debit card and get cash back. There were two
possible options that fit my situation: "Debit" and "Debit + Cash."

 Seeing as how the screen said "Select your payment type" in the title
area, I actually got confused: Does "Debit + Cash" mean I'm paying
partially with my debit card and partially with cash, or does it imply
that I only have the cash-back option if I select that option?

 I asked the nearby clerk, who didn't understand why I might be
confused, then finally came through with the answer that "Debit + Cash"
means "pay with debit card and get cash back." Of course, by then she
had decided that I also didn't know how to work the debit card machine
and walked me through that one, step by step as well.

 Bad UI, fellas. Bad UI.
