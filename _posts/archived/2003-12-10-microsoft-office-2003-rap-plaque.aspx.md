I'm sure you all remember the SharePoint Portal Server work that I was
doing for several months in a row just a little bit ago. Well, that was
part of the "Rapid Adoption Program" for Microsoft Office 2003. Today,
in the mail, I got a plaque for my efforts:

 ![Office 2003 RAP
Plaque]({{ site.url }}/images/20031210plaque.jpg)

 It says:

 *Microsoft Office
 Worldwide Office System Rapid Adoption Program
 Thank you for your outstanding contribution*

 I'm sure they printed like a million of these things, but I don't care.
Normally my reward for putting up with shit is... more shit. This time I
got a plaque. (I'm still dealing with Portal Server, but the difference
here is the recognition that I'm doing it.) I think that's pretty cool.

 (Oh, and it's actually rectangular; it's just the camera I used to take
the picture has a bit of a fisheye to it.)
