A note to people designing web sites: *Users can see the URL line*.

 I entered a sweepstakes and, after entering (and losing) I get a form
that asks me if I want to notify my friends of the ability to enter. The
URL looked like this:

 something.something.com/index.tbapp?page=**viral\_form**

 Viral form?!?! You'd think the site designers would have thought of
some less aggressive name for the thing.
