I've got the original Xbox 360 (not the Elite) so I don't have an HDMI
port on it. I'd upgrade to the Elite (maybe) except it would bring on
[the whole DRM
problem](/archive/2007/12/10/xbox-live-drm-eating-my-lunch.aspx) all
over again because I'd be switching consoles. No good.

out Mad Catz released [an HDMI conversion kit for Xbox
360](http://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=411&CategoryImg=Xbox_360_Accessories)
so you can just buy this adapter and still get the full 1080p goodness
you'd get from the Elite.

I saw this bad boy the other day in the [Buy
More](http://www.buy-more.net/) and thought it looked interesting, so I
mentioned it to my dad, who is also interested in stuff like this. It's
\$90 so it's a little more expensive than an impulse buy.

Dad promptly went out and bought it and says it is awesome. He says he
and my mom both can see a very obvious visual difference from using the
VGA cable and that it's so clear it almost hurts.

Obviously, your mileage may vary, but I think I'm putting this on my
list of things to get.
