Took my car in to the shop this morning to get it fixed from [my
one-way-grid
collision](/archive/2008/09/19/watch-those-one-way-grids.aspx). The
estimate is that it'll be done and back to me on Friday, but until then,
I'm stuck in a rental - a [Kia Rondo](http://www.kia.com/rondo/). My
usual car isÂ a [2002 Acura RSX
Type-S](http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/coupes/0106_acura_rsx_type_s/index.html),
so moving over to an odd SUV-identity-crisis with an automatic
transmission has me sort of weirded out. I don't really want to try
parking it in my garage because I can't figure out where the front and
back on the thing are yet.

It's Wednesday, but Friday is comin'...
