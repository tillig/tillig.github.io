The "comments" email address I had was pretty much just a spam magnet,
so I've killed it.  If you need to get in touch with me, use the contact
form on the blog, or send me an email directly (if you have my email
address already).  Sorry for the inconvenience this may cause folks who,
for some reason, had my actual email address down as "comments."
