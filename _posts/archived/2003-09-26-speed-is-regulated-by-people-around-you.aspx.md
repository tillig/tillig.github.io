Today's Traffic Asshole was driving a black Ford Escort station wagon.
Let me set the scene for you.

 I was driving along, going about 65 in the left lane (there were only
two lanes). The right lane was going around 55. About four car lengths
in front of me was another car, also going 65. Out of *nowhere* this
black station wagon hauled up onto my ass. I figured that there was no
point in getting over into the slower traffic, since I was passing them
anyway, and not four car lengths ahead of me the traffic wasn't going
any faster. No action required on my part.

 That isn't the way this guy saw it. He got over into the slow lane,
*zoomed* up onto the ass of the person who happened to be in front of
him, then got in front of me and *zoomed* up onto the ass of the car
that was previously in front of me. What was the point of that? Four car
lengths and no speed gain? Where did he think he was going?

 Lesson for the uninitiated: Regardless of how fast you might *like* to
go, your speed is always regulated by the *line of cars in front of
you*.
