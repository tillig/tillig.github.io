I came in to my blog a couple of minutes ago hoping that there was a new
post to read when I realized that it was *my blog* and there wouldn't be
anything new unless *I wrote it*.

 I think I'm losing it. Maybe I have a [memory
leak](/archive/2002/06/18/medal-of-kylie.aspx).

 I went to get my allergy shot this morning and was the first person
there. I'm always the first person there. I get there at like 7:40a and
they don't open until 8:00a, but the door's open so I just go in and
read whatever book I'm reading until I can get my shot. I went in today
and it was colder in the doctor's office than it was outside. How is
that even possible? If the heat is off inside and there's no air
conditioning, wouldn't the inside heat up and cool down at roughly the
same temperature as the outside? Not this time.

 Went to
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/mhsvortex)
today to fill up my pre-order schedule. I like getting prizes in the
mail. I ended up buying:

-   [*The Bourne
    Identity*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXXM/mhsvortex)
-   [*Lexx* Season 4, Volume
    1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007L4O6/mhsvortex)
-   [*Lexx* Season 4, Volume
    2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000083C4A/mhsvortex)
-   [*Angel* Season
    1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLEW/mhsvortex)
-   [*The Osbournes* Season
    1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLBW/mhsvortex)

I even still had a [$5 promotional gift certificate in my
account](/archive/2002/12/02/turkeys-bring-amazon-developments.aspx).
How sweet is that? Free shipping, and I'm good to go. I should be
getting something fun and new in the mail every, like, week or two
between now and April.

 Due to my fear of atrophy (and the fact that Jenn and I both have these
distinct *non-abs* where we should see *abs*), we've started another
get-in-shape routine. The flavor this month is
[*BalanceBall*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006IX6L/mhsvortex).
We got one of those big yoga exercise ball things and a beginner's
workout DVD because we're big pussies.

 After doing it a couple of times, I've had a chance to form an opinion.
First, this is definitely my kind of workout. It's mostly stretching and
relaxation, so after I'm done I'm totally chilled out. Second, I'd much
rather sit on the ball and bounce like it's a hippity-hop than actually
do any sort of workout. The thing is, bouncing on the ball is also good
for you if you do it for like 5 minutes or more. Finally, the chick on
the yoga video is one of those fruitcake hippies who tells you to
breathe and "create space inside yourself" and "feel the stress flow out
of you" and crap like that. The chick bugs me, but the workout's pretty
decent.

 The only problem is that because it dedicates itself to showing you
relaxation and stretching techniques, there's no *workout* to it. That
is, I'm not toning up by lounging around. Now that we've done this one a
few times, I think Jenn's looking at getting a new one that has a little
more *work* to it.

 Hey, man, anything's better than sit-ups.
