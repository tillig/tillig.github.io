Well, I've got training once again next week, this time for, uh...
ASP.NET. Damn, I go to so many of these things that I can't even
remember which class I'm going to. I just sort of show up and learn
stuff.
 
 I got a statistics report from [Marty](http://www.mildperil.net) to
show me how many folks are visiting. According to the report, I *average
**83 visitors a day***. Let's assume that up to half could be either
repeat visitors or search engines, that's still like 40 people a day
coming to read about how clever and funny I am. I can probably pick out
maybe 10 folks I know show up... *who are all the rest of you people?*
 
 This is an official APB for comments - if you read this bad boy, leave
me a comment so I know you're out there. It doesn't even have to be
anything special, just a "hey, I'm out here lurking" sort of thing. I'm
really curious how many folks are coming in from out of town, so to
speak.
 
 I bought the Evanescence album
[*Fallen*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000089RVX/mhsvortex)
today and I'm really digging it. I like the song "Bring Me To Life" from
the *Daredevil* soundtrack, and the rest are just as cool. If you're
into the alternative rock scene, go get it. It's sort of like Sarah
McLachlan goes Linkin Park.
