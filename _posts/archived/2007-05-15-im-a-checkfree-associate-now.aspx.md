![Corillian is now a part of
CheckFree]({{ site.url }}/images/20070515acquisition.png)It's
official - [Corillian is now a part of
CheckFree](http://www.corillian.com/corporate/news/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=344).
That makes me an "associate," as CheckFree employees are called. Sweet.

 There's a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss more detail about what's
going on and the changes to come. I'm given to understand that we'll
keep the Corillian name (which means my work email doesn't change, which
is good because that'd just be a pain).

 It's an exciting time to be a part of the [Consumer
Banking](http://www.corillian.com/products/consumer/default.aspx) team
at Corillian. I look forward to what's in store.
