I updated [the DHTML tooltip
script](/archive/2004/09/29/amazon-associate-dhtml-image-tooltips.aspx)
to allow peaceful coexistence of my DHTML tooltips and the Amazon
"Product Previews" link enhancement script, but I'm having issues
getting everything to work together on my site. In a very simple page -
the example included with the DHTML tooltip script - everything rocks.
On my blog, everything works great in Firefox 2.0. In IE 7, I get all
sorts of weird artifacts - the CSS on the page goes nuts, making the
titles of my articles look different; the Product Preview that pops up
is entirely missing the product title and sometimes other things; and a
JavaScript error pops up telling me that there's a "syntax error" (but
doesn't provide much information beyond that).

 I've sent a note to Amazon to ask for help. Hopefully they can hook me
up.
