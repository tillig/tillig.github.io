In my [continued](/archive/2006/09/18/dvd-iso-via-mediaportal.aspx)
[research](/archive/2006/10/02/mediaportal-and-dvd-iso-seems-to-work.aspx)
into how best to go about digitizing my movie collection and making it
more accessible than it currently is (binders full of DVDs aren't too
accessible) I'm reconsidering my position on storing the movie as ISO
and might now just copy the
[VIDEO\_TS](http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/dvd-structure.htm) folders
to a drive instead. (I like [DVD
Decrypter](http://www.doom9.org/index.html?/dvddec.htm) for this.)
 
 It turns out that both [MediaPortal](http://www.team-mediaportal.com/)
and [My Movies for Media Center](http://www.mymovies.name/) will support
ISO playback using Daemon Tools, but ISO doesn't work for Media Center
Extenders like the Xbox 360. Ideally you'd just store one copy of the
movie, but with ISO not working, saving ISO would mean having to save
two versions of it - the ISO and a MCE-compatible version. Talk about
space usage.
 
 My Movies has a document talking about [which format to store movies
in](http://www.mymovies.name/documentation/whatdvdformattochoose.aspx)
(they recommend VIDEO\_TS over ISO) and [the Xbox 360 as a media
extender](http://www.mymovies.name/documentation/xbox360extender.aspx).
Turns out [Transcode360](http://runtime360.com/projects/transcode-360/)
can handle VIDEO\_TS now, too, so from a "lossless" standpoint, it may
be that VIDEO\_TS is the way to go.
 
 You can even [burn VIDEO\_TS to a watchable
DVD](http://www.gromkov.com/faq/faq2004-0026.html) later, which was my
original notion of saving the ISO - so if the original DVD gets
corrupted or scratched, I can re-create it. The only thing I don't know
is how the various audio tracks (commentary, etc.) and extras (menus,
behind-the-scenes videos) live on via VIDEO\_TS and/or manifest on the
Media Center Extender.
