Jenn and I normally go work on a professional fireworks shoot each year,
but this year was special - we were in charge of our own show in Sandy,
OR.

The show was actually sponsored by the City of Sandy and they had some
donations come in to make the show larger than last year's, so it turned
out there was a lot to shoot. I think we calculated it at just under 900
individual shells and seven pre-fused boxes.

Setup took five or six hours because it was pretty hot out and we took
frequent breaks to rest and rehydrate. Something different about this
show than we'd dealt with in previous shows was that we were burying the
mortars in sand above ground, rather than having a trench to put them in
or wood legs to attach to the mortar racks. Setup went smoothly, though,
and we had a couple of hours to eat and rest before the actual shoot.

The show proper lasted 33 minutes, which was almost 20 minutes longer
than the previous year's show. We were told we were trying for a "20+
minute show" and we thought we'd try for about 25 minutes so it wasn't
too long (people get bored) and it wasn't too short. We didn't know how
fast it would go, so we started off taking our time... but Jenn was
watching us with a stopwatch and saw that we got to the 1/4 mark and
were eight minutes in, so we sped up. By the time we'd shot half the
shells, we were going as fast as we could light them.

Clean up went super-fast, just around an hour, and we got a bit of help
of some of the community emergency response team folks in picking up
garbage. While half the team picked up trash and raked, the other half
loaded the mortars back on the truck, and that was that. Smooth sailing.

Our team was new to the fireworks game and they did a fantastic job. Big
kudos to Ronda, Paul, Torin, K, Curt, Jessica, and Garth - you guys were
awesome.

Really, there were only two small snafus we ran into.

First, I'm not super comfortable driving large trucks, and this was a
pretty decent sized truck. I had a little bit of a mishap involving the
gutter above my garage and the back of the truck due to some misjudgment
in the length of the truck. No damage to the truck at all, but I'll be
getting a new gutter.

Second, we had a rough time finding someone to open the gate and let us
onto the field to start the setup. Sgt. Shawn Burns from Sandy Police
totally came to our rescue with that and with anything else we needed
all day - huge thanks to Sgt. Burns for all of the help!

After all was over we got several compliments from the people working
security and from some of the spectators saying this was they best show
they'd seen in years. That's really what makes it worthwhile - the cheer
of the crowd and the ability to legally and safely light off some pretty
amazing explosives.

Definitely a good show to work. It could have been a little cooler, but
only having to drive an hour or so and easy clean up? Can't be beat.

**UPDATE:** Here's a video of the show from the crew perspective:
