[![Gwen Stefani as... a paper
doll.]({{ site.url }}/images/20070906gwendolls.png)](http://www.hp.com/gwen)Okay,
so from the department of "Really Weird Marketing Tie-Ins," there's [a
whole Gwen Stefani page over on the Hewlett-Packard
site](http://www.hp.com/gwen) where you can print off Gwen Stefani stuff

- paper dolls, book covers, CD labels, her tour book...Â  Interesting,
but I'm not sure I *get it*.
