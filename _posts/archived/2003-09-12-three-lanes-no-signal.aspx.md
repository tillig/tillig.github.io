I said that Traffic Asshole of the Week may occur more often than once a
week, and I was dead on. This morning I found another candidate for the
title.

 I was heading in to work, when I see this guy in an SUV (big surprise
there) *fly* across *three lanes of traffic without signaling*:

 That's right, all the way from the on ramp to the fast lane, no signal,
no pause. He then runs right up on the bumper of the car in front of me
and slams on the brakes. Good job there, man.

 Then, just as fast as he flew *into* the fast lane, he flies *back
across the three lanes of traffic...*

 *... and gets OFF THE FREEWAY!*

 What, may I ask, was the purpose of *that?* He wasn't on the freeway
for more than maybe a mile or so; why do all this ridiculous
maneuvering?

 A perfect candidate for the title *Traffic Asshole of the Week*.
