I went looking for a list of [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) URL hacks
so I could send a link to a video and have it start at a particular
time. I ended up coming across a couple of great posts that have some
neat tricks.

-   [10 YouTube URL Tricks You Should Know
    About](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-youtube-url-tricks-you-should-know-about/)
-   [10 Useful YouTube URL Tips and
    Tricks](http://www.ampercent.com/youtube-url-tricks/2760/)

My favorite two:

-   **View high quality videos**: Add "&fmt=18" for stereo 480 x 270
    resolution or "&fmt=22" for stereo 1280x720 resolution.
-   **Start at a specific time**: Add "\#t=XmYs" where X is the number
    of minutes and Y is the number of seconds, like "\#t=5m16s" to start
    at 05:16. If you just want seconds (like to start at 0:14) you can
    just put the number, like "\#t=14".

Check out the rest of the tips on the original sites - good stuff!
