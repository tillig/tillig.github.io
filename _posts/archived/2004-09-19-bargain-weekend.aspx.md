I've had quite a weekend, all on the cheap.

 First, I looked all over town for some cord winders to help manage some
of the cables for the controllers on the PS2. I have some, but one broke
and I need to replace it - the cords on this thing are unruly. I looked
high and low and was about to pay [$5 each for them at
cableorganizer.com](http://cableorganizer.com/cord-it/) when I found
them [two for $2.50 at the APC Factory
Outlet](http://buy.apc.com/commerce/storefronts/factoryoutlet/default.asp?storefrontcode=apcfo&countrycode=us).
I bought four pairs so I won't have to go looking again for a while. I
hope. Cost: $15 ($10 for the winders, $5 for shipping).

 Then I went out looking for a new pair of slippers. I come home every
day, put on my slippers, then wear the bastards all over - out to get
the mail, watering the lawn, barbecuing... it's almost like I just need
a floppy, comfortable pair of shoes. What it ends up meaning is that
whatever slippers I get, I need them to have a nice, durable sole but
still be cushy inside.

 Anyway, I've worn out the insides of the slippers I bought last year
and the interior comes out in hanks when you pull your foot out.
Unfortunately, slippers are a seasonal item and don't normally come out
in stores until late fall/early winter. It happened that Fred Meyer had
them in stock, though, and I got some pretty rugged slippers for the
bargain price of $16.

 Finally, Sunday (today) was the Corillian Engineering department picnic
at the [Oregon Zoo](http://www.zooregon.org/). A great lunch, free
all-day pass to the zoo, passes to the [new HimalAmazon motion simulator
ride](http://www.zooregon.org/Simulator/Himalamazon/main.htm) (hella
fun), and passes to a behind the scenes tour of [the Alaska Tundra
exhibit](http://www.zooregon.org/Exhibits/alaska.htm) where we got to
see how they take care of the grizzly bears, musk oxen, and wolves.
Fun!

 I love looking at the animals at the zoo. My favorites are the polar
bears and the giraffes (well, they're *all* my favorites, but I really
like those two). Here's the polar bear, hanging out. ([Also available in
a 1024 x 768 wallpaper size, if you really like

 I remember when you used to be able to feed the giraffes at the zoo and
ride elephants. They don't let you do that anymore. I can see maybe not
riding elephants, but come on - I wanna feed giraffes!

 Something I hadn't seen before - a giraffe bending over to get some
food off the ground. Quite the contortions it has to do to get down
there:

 Wait a sec... let's investigate that a little closer, shall we?

 That's what I thought.

 So now I have a new mission next time I'm at the zoo: take a picture of
the nuts on every animal I visit. Heh.

 Oh, but to tie that all back into the "bargain weekend" theme: It cost
me $3.50 to ride the light rail from Hillsboro out to the Zoo and back;
and $2.50 for a zoo key (a plastic key that you can put into electronic
boxes around the zoo that tell you things about the animals - Jenn and I
have a bunch of different ones and get a new one each time we go).
Total: $6.

 Thus, for all the cool stuff I got and the fun I had this weekend, it
only ended up costing a total of $37, which is a pretty cheap weekend
if you really think about it. I'm stoked.
