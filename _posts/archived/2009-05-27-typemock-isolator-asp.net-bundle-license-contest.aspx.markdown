OK, so not really a contest so much as a very short "first come, first
serve." [Typemock launched their ASP.NET
bundle](/archive/2009/05/19/free-typemock-isolator-licenses-asp.net-bundle-launch.aspx)
with Typemock Isolator and Ivonna, an ASP.NET testing tool, and
**they've given me a license to hand out to a lucky reader**.

**First person to leave a comment on this post wins.** Make sure you
fill in the "email address" field so I can contact you back. (Your
address won't actually appear on the blog, and I won't use it for
anything other than getting you your license, so don't worry about
spam.)

Good luck!

[UPDATE: The prize has been claimed!]
