[Grant Drake (of NCoverExplorer note) speaks out about his dislike for
Sandcastle.](http://www.kiwidude.com/blog/2007/01/building-castles-on-quicksand.html)
I've already [voiced my negative opinions on
Sandcastle](/archive/2006/09/06/sandcastle-i-dont-get-it.aspx). Months
later, I still dislike it. Unfortunately, I've been fighting with it for
so long that I don't know if there's much they can do to address my
dislike. There's a lot of work still to do...
