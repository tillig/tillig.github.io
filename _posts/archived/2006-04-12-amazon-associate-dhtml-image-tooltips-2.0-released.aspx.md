The new version has some pretty major restructuring and does lots of
stuff better to allow for a more peaceful coexistence with other
scripts:

Converted to "object oriented" JavaScript to avoid name clashes.

Fixed minor bug with positioning in newer browsers.

Safely attaching to all events (thanks to Phil Haack for this).

Updated so script is placed in HEAD of document.
