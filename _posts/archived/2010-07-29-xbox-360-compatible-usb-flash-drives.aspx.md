My Xbox 360 profile was on a 512MB memory unit and with the USB flash
drive update to the system, I figured it was time to move on up.

Xbox 360 has some sort of "test" it runs USB drives through to determine
if the drive "meets recommendations" or is "below recommended
performance." If it's below the recommended performance, you'll
supposedly get degraded experiences in loading/saving games, reading
your profile information from the drive, etc. Unfortunately, [the Xbox
360 storage page](http://www.xbox.com/storage/) really doesn't tell you
which drives work other than their Xbox 360 branded drives.

To that end, I tried a couple of drives and found one that worked (the
Lexar JumpDrive Firefly) and one that didn't (SanDisk Cruzer). I figure
I'll put that info here, and if there are people who have experiences
they want to contribute, I'll add it. [Send me a link](/contact.aspx) to
the drive on Amazon or whatever and whether or not it "met the
recommendations."

Prices listed are current as of the day I added the drive to the list.

<sup>1</sup> The drive failed the original configuration but on subsequent
attempts succeeded.

Again, **if you find one that works or one that doesn't**, or if you're
using one of the above and can confirm functionality, leave a comment or
[use the contact link](/contact.aspx) on the site to **[send me a
note](/contact.aspx) and a link to the drive on Amazon** or whatever. In
the event where someone finds a drive that works and someone else finds
that same drive doesn't work, I'll probably put it on the "fails" list.
Better a drive that works for everyone than one that works for "some
people."

Note: Some folks have found that the first time you plug the drive in
and test it, Xbox 360 says the drive passes, but on subsequent tests it
fails. I'll move those drives from the "pass" to "fail" tables as
they're discovered.
