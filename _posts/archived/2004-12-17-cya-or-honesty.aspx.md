I got the following email from my mom the other day:

> OK. So you have a 2 pound box of See's candy on your desk and no one
> is around but one person, and he is a cubicle up one and over one. You
> DROP the whole damn box of candy on the floor and they all roll out.
> Do you pick the sons-of-bitches up and put them back in the box and
> never say a word (maybe a small "shit" would be uttered) or do you
> throw the works away and tell everyone what happened?
>
> GUESS WHAT YOUR MOTHER DID????

 *My mom rules.*
