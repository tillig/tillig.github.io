It's amazing the stupid shit I find funny.

 For example, a long time ago (okay, it was around three years ago, but
it seems a lot longer) I saw a skit on [*Saturday Night
Live*](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/) called "Celebrity Jeopardy"
([here's the
transcript](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99cjeopardy.phtml)) where
[Norm MacDonald](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Macdonald,+Norm) played [Burt
Reynolds](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Reynolds,+Burt) during a Celebrity
[Jeopardy](http://jeopardy.station.sony.com) tournament. Right in the
middle of it, he changes the name on his name tag from "Burt Reynolds"
to "Turd Ferguson."

 I laughed my ass off. Every time I hear it or even think about it, I
can't stop laughing. I don't know why - it's totally random, but it just
cracks me up.

 Another one that gets me - "Carl the Big Mean Bagpipe Eater" from the
John [Goodman episode of *Muppets
Tonight*](http://tbrowne.best.vwh.net/MuppetsTonight/JohnGood.html).
Right in the middle of the show, this monster comes out, says, "Hi! My
name is Carl, and now I'm gonna eat these bagpipes," stuffs some
bagpipes in his mouth, and burps. It's random. It's stupid.

 I watched that and rewound the video tape and watched it again probably
30 times in a row the night that aired. It just doesn't get old.

 I sort of think it's the randomness of the thing that cracks me up. But
I hate slapstick comedy (the [*Naked Gun*
movies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065U35/mhsvortex) are
the height of all that is wrong with American cinema) and those are the
most random things I can think of. Hmmmm. I suppose I'll have to puzzle
on that and get back to you.
