We've been watching a lot of DVDs lately. In particular, TV on DVD.
[*Wonderfalls*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GAO18/mhsvortex)
has been a particular favorite (I *highly* recommend it).

 I got an email today from Amazon that mentioned [*La Femme Nikita*
season 3](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0008ENIR0/mhsvortex)
is coming out on June 28, so I had to pre-order that. I also saw that
[*Lois and Clark* season
1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00080ZG2O/mhsvortex) came
out, so I ordered that as well. (I had every single episode of that on
videotape until we moved, when I realized I couldn't be carting around
that many videotapes all the time. I kept the first and last episodes,
and I think that's it. Hopefully they'll come out with the rest of the
seasons on DVD as well.)

 Those should be shipping out July 2. Maybe by then I'll have a fully
functional TV to watch them on.

 Speaking of the TV... did I mention that this weekend it made the
loudest \*snap\* noise and the picture went out for a second? Happened
twice. The audio was fine the whole time, but the picture sure wasn't. I
told the guy I'm working with at Magnolia about it and he said he'd talk
to their service guy about it. I'm hoping to hear something back soon.
Maybe today? I can only hope.
