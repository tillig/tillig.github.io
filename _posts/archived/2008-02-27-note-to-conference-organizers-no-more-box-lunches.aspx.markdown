OK, conference organizers, listen up:

**You never get the box lunch right.** Ever. Even when I was in grade
school and you were the field trip organizer, you still never got it
right.

Not everyone wants a pre-made meat sandwich, and not everyone who
doesn't want meat is a vegetarian. Giving me the choice between soggy
ham, limp turkey, or sprouts-on-rye isn't a choice. I might consider the
ham, but you made it six hours ago, threw a really moist tomato on
there, and wrapped it tight as you could in plastic, thereby ensuring
the tomato juice permeates the bread and makes it entirely inedible.

Normally I wouldn't even complain, except you make the assumption
everyone's going to eat the box lunch so you don't give me enough time
to go somewhere and get something else - **I eat your lunch, or I don't
eat at all**.

I am tired of eating a lunch that consists of an undersized apple, a
small bag of greasy chips, and a cookie. I'm tired of having people with
lower food standards look at me with that pathetic gaze and offer me
another bag of greasy chips.

There are ways you can fix this and still keep your precious box lunch.
Seriously.

-   **Stop pre-making the sandwiches**. Put the individually packaged
    ingredients for each sandwich in the box instead so I can assemble
    it myself, ensuring the bread isn't soggy and that I can entirely
    ignore that overripe tomato slice.
-   **Offer the peanut butter and jelly option**. Yeah, I know there are
    nut allergy people. I think they can figure out not to eat the PB&J.
-   Actually **ask me what I want** during conference registration. Not
    just a checkbox for the "vegetarian option," but actually a menu of
    four or five different things you could package up that maybe aren't
    sandwiches. Or let me select which ingredients go on my sandwich
    from the menu. It can't be that hard.
-   **Buffet.**Â  I get a plate, I walk down the line of available items,
    I pick up what I want. Wow.
-   **Give me the money** you'd have spent on the box lunch **and enough
    time to hit the Burger King down the street**. I'll come back
    happier and probably have change left over.

Conference organizers everywhere, heed my call! **No more box lunches!**
