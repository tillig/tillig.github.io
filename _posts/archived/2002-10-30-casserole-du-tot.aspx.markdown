We were strapped for dinner ideas last night so we broke out my mom's
recipe for tater tot casserole (or, as I have come to call it,
*Casserole du Tot*).

 It was actually pretty decent, all things considered. Jenn claims it
was her first ever casserole creation experience, and I think it was
mine, too. I've eaten various casseroles before, but never have I made
one.

 This one happened to make like 20 pounds of casserole, though, so I
have a feeling it's leftovers for another week or so. I mean, it calls
for a *two pound bag of tater tots*. That's a big-a casserole-a.

 Something I forgot to mention yesterday: On Monday night, Jenn and I
attempted to go to the sneak preview of
[*I-Spy*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0297181). I was pretty psyched about
seeing it, and I think Jenn was pretty excited, too. But I say
"attempted to go" because that's all it was - an attempt.

 Here's how it went down: I signed up for a contest to get a free movie
pass to see the movie. I got the pass. Jenn and I met up at home around
6:00p and we were downtown, parked (for *\$5*, no less, because God
forbid they have the preview at a theater with a parking lot; of course,
my logic was that the movie was free, so \$5 for parking was no biggie),
and in the theater by 6:15p. The movie was set to start at 7:00p.

 We got in line and there were, oh, 100 people in line, give or take,
when we got there. That's not bad; the theater probably seats 300 or so,
I think. I've been to loads of these previews and that's not uncommon to
see that many people there. So we got in line and a few minutes later
the line starts moving. They let like five people in, then say, "Sorry!
The theater's full!" *What?!* You let *five fucking people in*. It's not
full.

 But it *is* full.

 Turns out, the place that I got the tickets from thought they had the
whole preview to themselves, so they gave away enough tickets to fill
the seats. But another place was giving away tickets, too - and enough
to fill the seats. So only half the people who got tickets were able to
get in.

 I understand they "slightly overbook the theater" to "ensure a good
turnout," but that's ridiculous. Especially when the place I got the
tickets from only wanted to know one thing about you - "Are you
*definitely* going to be able to make it?" I made it, and I got
screwed.

 In the end, Jenn and I went to [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com)
and I got me a [Venti<sup>tm</sup> Mocha
FrappuccinoÂ®](/archive/2002/04/18/coffee--a-primer.aspx). So it wasn't a
*total loss*, but I was admittedly a little peeved.
