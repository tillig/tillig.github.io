Saturday was cake tasting (and decision making) day, so Jenn,
[Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), Tif, and I all went down to
[JaCiva's](http://www.jacivas.com/) to decide what kind of wedding cake
we're going to have.
 
 Pretty much anything JaCiva's makes is awesome (which is why we went
with them), and after some tough decision making, we're getting a
four-tier cake that serves 125 and breaks down like this:
-   First tier (bottom) - 14" - Chocolate Fudge cake with Bavarian
    Custard filling
-   Second tier - 10" - Pink Champagne cake with Strawberry Preserves
    filling
-   Third tier - 8" - Poppy Seed Pudding cake with Raspberry Preserves
    filling
-   Fourth tier (top) - 6" - Pina Colada cake with Pina Colada
    (pineapple, coconut, and rum) filling


 The style is called "Chocolate Flow." Each tier is iced in white and
then dark chocolate is poured on top and allowed to run slightly down
the sides, creating a nice flowing effect. It has red icing roses with
silver leaf petals on each tier that accent nicely against the dark
brown and white cake. Beautiful (and, in fact, reasonably affordable).
 
 Sunday Jenn and Tiff met up with Jenn's mom and sister and they picked
out bridesmaid dresses. I haven't seen the dresses, but Jenn assures me
that they look great. I have seen the shoulder wrap portion of the
dresses, and the red that Jenn chose is gorgeous. It's going to be
great.
 
 That said... Jenn went back with Tiff to see how things would match up
with her dress, and looking at the dress it turns out there are some
holes in it that Jenn didn't see when she first purchased it. She got it
from a charity event for a steal, so it's not like there's a whole load
of money out the door, but she really loves the dress and now she sees
that someone must have torn some of it when they tried it on or
something, which sucks. Now she's going to talk to a bridal shop and see
if it can be fixed. If not... well, looks like she'll be dress shopping
again. That would suck because, like I said, she loves the dress, but
she's like me: just "repairing it" may not be enough - you know it
wasn't perfect at one point, so it's going to bug you.
 
 I told her we should call her dress "Distort-o-Dress" after [the TV
incident](/archive/2005/01/31/television-nightmare.aspx) that ended up
causing me to get [a new big-screen
TV](/archive/2005/06/20/end-of-an-era.aspx) ("you only see it if you're
looking for it, but since you know it's there, you always see it...").
That got a smile, which I'm glad for. It'll all work out. At least we
caught it early, right?
