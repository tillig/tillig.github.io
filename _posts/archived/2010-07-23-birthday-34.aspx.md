It's my birthday today and I'm 34 years old. A hearty thanks to the
folks who have sent me good birthday wishes via the various
communication mechanisms at their disposal including, but not limited
to: Twitter, Facebook, email, snail mail, text message, BlackBerry
messenger, Google Chat, and telephone. I do appreciate it.

The [day ain't over yet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XBi2p428tE),
but it's been a good birthday so far.

Last night my parents came by for a little while to visit. It was good
to see them and they left [a funny "Dadcat"
shirt](http://www.crazyshirts.com/product/mens/crew+neck+t-shirt+navy+dad+cat.do?extcmp=CSEGGPmen&code=csggp&CAWELAID=464069004)
(because my girl cat lays on my stomach just like the cat on the shirt),
some cool Hawaiian boxer shorts made from bamboo, and a pin from the
Maui Hard Rock Cafe (I have a small collection).

One of our cat boys, Stan, started the day out by wishing me a happy
birthday very loudly from outside the bedroom door. He provided an
enthusiastic serenade about the day from 5:00a all the way until 6:00a
when Jenn got up to get ready for work. He is outside the office door
right now wishing me a happy birthday still. Still loud. Still
enthusiastic. Lovely.

Jenn gave me her gifts before she left:

    by Wil Wheaton: I love Wil's blog so I'm looking forward to the
    book.
-   [***Army of Two - The 40th
    Day***](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W0Y5VM?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001W0Y5VM):
    I played the first [*Army of
    Two*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJFGE?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ELJFGE)
    and had a lot of fun with it. Jenn and I even played it through
    co-op. Looking forward to this one.
-   [***Alice in Verse - The Lost Rhymes of
    Wonderland***](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982508999?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0982508999):
    I'm a Wonderland freak and this looks amazing.

    Boogie***](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ES0MKE?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002ES0MKE)
    by RuPaul: I love disco/techno music and that [*Drag
    Race*](http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml)
    show is a train wreck I can't peel my eyes away from. Yeah, it's a
    guilty pleasure. I'm sharing it with you. Respect that.

I've got the day off from work, which means I can do whatever I want,
including not putting any gel in my hair. My head looks like a dandelion
puff, but I'm cool with that.

After I'm done here, I'm going to go to McDonald's and treat myself to
[a bacon, egg, and cheese
McGriddle](http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/breakfast/bacon_egg_cheese_mcgriddles.html),
my favorite. Then I'll probably do some more mundane things like
shopping at Costco, but I'll be savoring the memory of that McGriddle,
man.

I don't know if we have some friends coming over tonight or not. If so,
cool. Either way, I may end up rolling some *Borderlands* with my dad.
We're trying to crack level 40. Since the DLC for it is on sale next
week, we'll probably grab it then.

Tomorrow... well, there's a family gathering, but it's not for my
birthday - it's for my cousin who recently passed. Sort of a downer, so
we'll just move on. (Also, I anticipate a lot of "What have you been up
to?" questions which I can't answer because how do you explain
"implementing multitenant dependency injection in Autofac" to a
non-technical person?)

Sunday I do have some friends coming over and I anticipate there being
some Rocking and Banding the likes of which have never been seen before.
Or maybe we'll just get some dinner. Either way, that'll be fun.

So, again, thanks to those who've sent in birthday wishes. It's time for
me to go get my McGriddle!
