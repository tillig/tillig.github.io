There's a lot of [Silverlight](http://www.silverlight.net) content
floating around at [MIX07](http://visitmix.com), so I thought I'd check
out some different stuff.

 The session on integrating web-oriented content into Office was lightly
attended but very interesting. There are a lot of services out there and
a lot of Microsoft Office users. The idea is that a user experience can
be much richer if you don't make the user leave Office to get to the
data they need - instead, integrate the data right into Office.

 I like the idea. While it does mean an additional download/install for
a user, as an additional offering for ways to access data, this is good
stuff.

 Demos were done using Visual Studio "Orcas" (an as-yet-unreleased build
- so you can't do all the things quite as easily as the demos showed,
but once it's out, it looks like extending Office is a piece of cake)
and Visual Studio Tools for Office.

 Some of the things shown - creating custom ribbons; integrating a
hosted web browser in a task pane; creating Windows Presentation
Foundation controls and displaying/using them; custom form creation and
integration in Outlook (very cool - based on message content, a specific
set of controls becomes active).

 Two specific demos caught my eye, both in Outlook. The first was a
custom form that lets you get sales contact data mailed to you and when
you open the message, you can select a contact to see a map pop up and
show you the geographic location of the contact. Select multiple
contacts and it builds you a route and shows you directions on how to go
from one contact to another. The second was plugin that worked against
RSS messages such that when you're reading a post in Outlook you can
click a button to show a panel that has the original blog post displayed
in a browser so you can see it in its original context.

 Anyway, very cool stuff. I can see that this would be more valuable to
more internal IT-style development, but also opens up some nice
value-added services. What if you could get an email notifying you of an
incoming bill and click a button right in Outlook to pay it?
