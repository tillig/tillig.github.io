Well, I think I've got this thing converted over to CSS pretty much so
I'm not using tabular formatting for anything but forms. It's looking
pretty good, and my average entry size is down by around 2KB each, which
just goes to show you how bloated old HTML can be.
 
 I'd figure out my actual space savings, but I can't SSH out of here -
they *conveniently* use non-SOCKS proxy servers to get onto the web - so
I can't connect to anything on a console level. Or FTP, for that matter,
since their proxy is HTTP only.
 
 Regardless, I'm pleased, because now I can apply color changes and
whatnot in a *much* easier fashion. No biggie to you guys, but huge
stuff for me.
