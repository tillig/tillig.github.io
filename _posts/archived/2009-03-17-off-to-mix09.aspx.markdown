I've got some work to do this morning, but come noon, I'm off to [the
MIX09 conference](http://visitmix.com/). I don't travel much, and rarely
alone, but I do love me some Las Vegas, so I'm looking forward to it.
There are a lot of folks I'm looking forward to meeting up with when I
get there that I've corresponded with online a lot. Should be good
times. I will, of course, [tweet](http://twitter.com/tillig)and blog the
experience.
