This weekend I proved conclusively that I am a true Gamerpoint Whore by
completing the [Old Spice Experience
Challenge](http://xboxrewards.msgamestudios.com/challengesandrewards/ChallengeDetail.aspx?id=4),
increasing my Gamerscore by 1500 in about a week. Oh, hell yes. I plowed
through [*King
Kong*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0EFJC/mhsvortex) most
of last week and finished
[*Gun*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009Z3I0A/mhsvortex)
this weekend. Good times.
 
 Jenn was at my cousin's wedding shower all day Saturday and ended up
staying over at my aunt's house (the shower was three hours away and my
mom didn't feel like making the trip up and back the same day, so they
stayed over), returning Sunday afternoon. That left me home alone.
Hmmmm.
 
 Saturday my dad and I had planned on getting our Xbox on over the
network but his router wasn't configured to [forward the right
ports](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/908874) or something so while we
were able to connect to other people, we weren't able to connect to each
other. I guess that's the behavior you see when the router's giving you
grief. Instead, we ended up watching some movies and hanging out, which
was fun. It's always good to hang with Dad.
 
 Sunday I cleaned up around the house a bit and when Jenn got home we
went out for [some Indian food](http://www.curryleafpdx.com). Can't get
enough of that butter chicken.
 
 Monday Jenn and I trekked around town, getting the usual chores done
and gathering supplies to make a cat scratching post because the new cat
could legitimately be considered a Weapon of Mass Destruction. We figure
by making the thing we'll get exactly what we're looking for and save
between \$10 and \$20 at least. Cat furniture is expensive.
 
 We also took a look at some of the projects we'll be doing this spring
that we'll be putting off. I'm generally in charge of indoor repairs and
projects while Jenn is on external projects.
 
 I know we've got some [crown
molding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_molding) to put up and the
caulking around some of the windows needs to be replaced, so I'll be in
charge of those efforts. We might also need to paint the master bathroom
since the walls in there are looking a little drab from moisture and so
on. I'll probably look at doing some of the caulking over the course of
the next few weeks and the rest closer to spring.
 
 Jenn's agreed to deal with getting a new layer of barkdust put in
(including organizing any prep work that needs to be done) and dealing
with, once and for all, this crappy spot in our backyard that gets
really soggy (plans and execution). It's nice to have someone you can
count on to get everything done without procrastinating and without
forgetting the details. Jenn rocks that way. That stuff will commence in
the April/May timeframe.
