Remember how [I just bought a new DVD
player](/archive/2007/04/16/electronics-dying.aspx) because my old one
wasn't playing movies? Now that I think about it, the movies it was
having trouble with were *Casino Royale* and *Stranger Than Fiction*.
The symptoms were basically the same as a bad disc - you put the disc
in, the player tries and tries to read it to no avail, and you end up
ejecting the disc.

 Did I just buy a new DVD player *because Sony screwed me*?

 At least I didn't buy a new *Sony* DVD player. It's a Samsung. :)
