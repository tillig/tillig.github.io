I play the IT guy in my family just like the rest of you geeks out
there, but some of the folks in my family have been making strides in
learning about tech stuff lately and I've been pretty impressed. My mom
has figured out how to get on Xbox Live all by herself and play *Beatles
Rock Band* with me online. That's *huge*. But bigger still - my Grandpa
just recently got his very first email account and has sent his first
email. *Huge*, I'm telling you. I can't tell you how proud I am of both
of them. Great stuff that just makes me smile.
