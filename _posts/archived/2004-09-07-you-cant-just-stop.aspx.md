I don't know what it was with today. Things just pissed me off. I got my
allergy shots and had a reaction (not bad, but enough to be annoying); I
got a filling and shelled out the dough for that; on the way to my
filling I ran into terrible traffic; and on the way back from my filling
I got stuck in the *world's worst traffic ever*. Like, to the point I
almost got out of the car and walked.

 Of course, it's been a while since I've run into a Traffic Asshole, so
today was the perfect day for that. Sadly, I didn't have my camera, but
the Asshole (white pickup, license BHT 101) decided he was well above
the law.

 I let it go when I exited the freeway to get onto a just-as-backed-up
side street and he jetted out from behind me to sit in the lane next to
me, just in front of my bumper, and signal his way into my lane. I
figured I'd be nice - which, in traffic, is against every fiber in my
being - and let the guy in.

 He did it the once, and I let it go. Then we got to a left-hand light
that turned onto a one-way street - the right lane turned right, the
left lane turned left. He decided he was going to turn into the left
lane, but he wanted to turn right.

 Rather than accepting he was hosed, he *stopped in the middle of the
fucking lane and wouldn't let anyone by*.

 Let's see a diagram of that.

lane]({{ site.url }}/images/20040907taotw.gif)

 For all you out-of-state people or folks that think this is OK: *It's
not fucking OK*. If it's busy traffic and you accidentally turn into the
wrong lane, *suck it up and deal with it*. Accept the consequences of
your stupid actions and *just go*.

 Oh, and if the guy behind you lays on the horn because you've stopped
in the middle of the fucking road, you have *absolutely zero right to be
pissed off*. *You're* the one fucking up. Accept it, apologize, and
*drive your Goddamn car*. You are, *singlehandedly*, the reason we have
traffic.
