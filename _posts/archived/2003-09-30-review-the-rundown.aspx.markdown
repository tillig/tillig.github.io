[*The Rundown*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327850/) is not a deep and
meaningful art film focusing on character development and subtle
subtexts that intertwine themselves to create a complex storyline.
 
 *The Rundown* **is** the most fun I've had at the theater in a long,
long time.
 
 *The Rundown* stars [The Rock](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425005/) as
a guy named Beck who works as a collector for a loan shark. Beck doesn't
want to be in the business, but he owes the loan shark, so he's doing
his time. As a last mission, the loan shark sends Beck into the Amazon
jungle to retrieve his son Travis, played by [Seann William
Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005405/).
 
 Beck heads into the jungle and havoc ensues. He runs into trouble with
the local warlord (played by Christopher Walken), he gets mixed up with
the rebel army fighting the warlord, and he keeps managing to lose his
target, Travis.
 
 In the end, of course, everything works out, but it's the journey
that's the fun. The movie starts you right out with a great fight scene
and doesn't slow down. The humor is great, the characters are quirky,
the action is brilliant. This is everything an action movie should be,
and I'm disappointed that they don't turn more out like this.
 
 The Rock finally really establishes himself as a viable action star (we
all knew he was, but this part was made for him). Seann William Scott
shows us he can be a character other than Stifler. And Christopher
Walken... well, I mean, it's Christopher Walken, man! How could it be
bad?
 
 This one's definitely worth paying full price for, and maybe even
twice. I'll definitely be getting it when it's out on DVD. If you
haven't seen it - go *right now*. If you have, *see it again*. Yes, it's
that good.
