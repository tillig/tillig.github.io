I just got commissioned to work on a demo for our product. It's supposed
to be static, so that a user could take the demo, unzip it on their
desktop, and just start right up with IE... but I looked at the existing
demo, which fills this requirement, and it's *hundreds of pages*, all of
which have embedded Javascript to take care of any sort of dynamic
stuff.
 
 Fuck that shit, man.
 
 I'm going to see if I can at least make *some* use of dynamic stuff, at
least for automatically including common elements like headers and
footers. I'm supposed to come up with *two* new demos (one new, one a
revised version of an existing demo) in five weeks of half-time work?
 
 I don't think so. Not the way they're asking for.
