I took Friday through Monday off not only because I need to start eating
up some of my PTO hours before I lose them, but also in celebration of
my 29th year on Earth.

 Friday consisted mainly of watching [*La Femme Nikita*, Season
3](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0008ENIR0/mhsvortex) on DVD
and entering my comics from my collection into
[ComicsPriceGuide.com](http://www.comicspriceguide.com/). I got
everything that's been bagged, boarded, and boxed into the online
database, so now I can submit the list of comics to my homeowner's
insurance company and get a rider on my policy.

 Saturday was party-day. [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and Tif
came over early and we went to [the local Indian
joint](http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/33626314/) and had some
excellent food for lunch.

 After that, we went and played a couple of games of laser tag. Laser
tag was great fun, except there was this one asshole who apparently
didn't understand the difference between *playing the game* and *just
scoring points*. For those who don't play laser tag, the idea is that
you have a certain number of shots (like your "ammo") and a certain
number of lives. When you run out of shots or you've been hit enough
times to run out of lives, you have to return to base to get more. If
you get hit, your "shields" go up and you can't shoot or be shot for
three seconds, at which time your shields go down. That three seconds is
supposed to give you time to run away.

 Shooting a person gives you a certain number of points based on the
location you hit the person; shooting the opposing team's base (there's
a target on the base) gets you a certain number of points.

 The idea is that you sneak towards the opposing team's base and try to
shoot it; if you get shot, you run away and "regroup" or whatever. This
asshole decided he only wanted to play for points, not play the game, so
he stood right under our base and just pulled the trigger over and over,
regardless of whether we were shooting him or not. Eventually he'd hit
our base a few times, and when he ran out of ammo or we shot him enough
times, he'd stroll leisurely back to his base, recharge, and come back
and do the same thing. Sort of defeats the purpose of the game.

 Of course, we all got tired of just standing there shooting this guy,
so we played and ran around and had fun. At the end of the game, this
guy comes out looking like he's one of the top players out there because
we got tired of screwing with him, but he didn't *play*, he just *stood
there*.

 Apparently this guy and his son come in all the time and that's just
what he does. That's his way of playing. Next time I find him, I'm
cramming that laser gun up his ass. That's bullshit.

 We finished laser tag and headed back to my house, where we were joined
by my friends Jason, Tracy, and Adam. We played some games, watched some
shows, and had far, far too much to drink. (We peaked when Stu started
making "Randoms" - just pour whatever you can grab into the cup until
it's full.)

 Got some pretty cool stuff from folks. In all, I got (not necessarily
credited by person):

- Anakin Skywalker Jedi Fighter
- [*Sopranos
    Cookbook*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446530573/mhsvortex)
    (I loooove Italian!)
- [*Blade
    Runner*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0790729628/mhsvortex)
- [*Beetlejuice*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0790731479/mhsvortex)
- [$15 gift certificate to
    iTunes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002CZPPG/mhsvortex)
- [Bruce Campbell's *Make
    Love*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312312601/mhsvortex)
- [*The Professional* Deluxe
    Edition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GVJEE/mhsvortex)
- An iPod car charger
- This weird sticky thing that you can use to stick your iPod to your
    dashboard
- A 64MB memory card for GameCube
- A game player connector thing that you can use to play GameBoy games
    through your GameCube on your TV
- A video switchbox to connect all the game consoles and things
    through

 Hopefully I didn't miss anything. The point is that I got a lot of cool
stuff from a lot of cool people, and thanks very much to those folks -
you all rock, and you know who you are.

 Sunday was spent recovering from Saturday. We were going to head to the
beach, but Stuart's "Random" caught up with him and we ended up taking
it easy on Sunday instead.

 Monday I finished [the new Harry Potter
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439784549/mhsvortex), and
it was excellent, but I can't believe she did what she did at the end. I
mean, it totally opens the door for this last book to be just about
anything, but *come on*.

 And now I'm back at work. I forgot to go get my allergy shot today, so
I'm going to have to do that tomorrow and listen to the shot clinic
nurse rip me a new one because I'm *a day late*, so I'm looking forward
to that. Plus I see that there's more to do on the current project
that's due at the end of the week than I anticipated, so I'd best get to
it.
