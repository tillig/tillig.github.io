Watched the [*Aladdin*
DVD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001I561E/mhsvortex) this
weekend. Good stuff. Thought it was interesting that the version of the
opening song on the soundtrack is different than the version on VHS and
DVD. Good to see it again, though.

 Saw a preview for a movie, [*National
Treasure*](http://www.nationaltreasure.com/). I think it could be cool.
Of course, I've seen a lot of trailers for movies I want to see but
haven't gotten to. Maybe I'll make this one.
