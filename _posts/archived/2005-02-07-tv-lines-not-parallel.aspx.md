My [television
woes](/archive/2005/02/02/geomagnetic-television-distortion.aspx) are
not yet over.
 
 I thought I could just ignore it, but it's bugging the crap out of me.
 
 Lines that should be displayed as parallel on the TV are not parallel.
For example, when I'm watching a widescreen movie, the black bars at the
top and bottom of the TV are not horizontal, nor are they parallel. In a
very slightly exaggerated style, it looks sort of like this:

anymore](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pQ5jrAom1m6DZh0AD854gLaCLQMhRsy2RUsmhM6iQq12kfWd0AobS8bwiOgbJ0zAYeCg0aTL7tYGEnOBz-v0hgW16R144-AG_A1ziTk6QRIE/20050207tvlines.gif?psid=1)
 
 I'm sure this is an artifact of the "purity alignment" it underwent,
and I did try to ignore it, but I can't - I bought the extended warranty
specifically for a case like this, and as far as I'm concerned, they'll
keep fixing it until I don't see a single impurity in that picture, like
the day I bought it. All I know is that while I'm watching a widescreen
movie on there, or looking through the digital cable guide (which lays
out the menus using horizontal and vertical lines, none of which are
straight), I can't see anything but the fact these lines aren't
straight, square, and parallel. And it *eats at me*.
