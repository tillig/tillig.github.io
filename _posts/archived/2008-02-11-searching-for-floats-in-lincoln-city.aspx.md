Sunday Jenn, I, and our friends Angela and Keaka gathered up in the
[Wagon Queen Family Truckster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/) and
headed down to [Lincoln City, OR](http://www.oregoncoast.org/home.php).
Every year [they place a bunch of glass floats up and down the
beach](http://www.oregoncoast.org/pages/glass-floats.php), and Angela's
totally into floats, so we went to help her find one.

After a couple of hours walking around on the beach, searching with the
other treasure hunters, we came up empty-handed. I was tempted to run to
a local shop and just buy a float and then hide it in the sand somewhere
to "find," but I couldn't sneak away. Somehow I think Angela would have
known anyway and probably given me a stern talking-to.

Next time I think I want to [blow my own glass
float](http://www.oregoncoast.org/foundry/), though it costs like $65
to do it. I think it'd be a pretty neat experience and you'd get to take
something cool home. I've never blown glass before. I did get myself
some [Mo's clam chowder](http://www.moschowder.com), which is always
worth the trip. And now, back to work!
