Yesterday my trim got repainted because it was looking sort of nasty and
flaking off a bit. Taking a little pride in ownership, I decided it was
about time to spruce the place up.

 I had to stay home all day because part of the repaint included the
front door, which hung open almost all day so the painters had access to
it and so it would dry nicely around the edges. At the end, I did a
walkthrough and looked at the job. Looked nice and clean. Awesome.

 Jenn was out with some friends last night so she didn't get to see the
paint. She went out this morning to check it out.

 Oh boy.

 Under the soffits where they painted, all the paint looked like it was
bubbling or dripping. You can see near the garage where it actually did
drip and got on my vinyl trim. That definitely wasn't there during the
walkthrough.

 I called the painters up and let them know what I'm seeing. They're
coming back out today to see about fixing it up. Why does this stuff
always have to be a pain? I guess I should be happy; at least they're
not leaving me in the lurch. We'll have to see how this goes.

 Other minor news - I think the house has settled in the last couple of
years and the door to the cats' room (which remains open all the time,
and which I had to close yesterday so the beasts didn't escape through
the open front door) really won't close anymore. The top of the door
rubs on the door frame. It was a little snug before, but now it's just
crazy. Looks like I've got something else to fix.
