Great post by Media Center MVP Pete Stagman on [how he handles ripping
and playing Blu-ray discs with Media Center and Windows Home
Server](http://www.nedmug.com/Blogs/tabid/226/PostID/30/Ripping-Storing-and-Playing-Blu-Rays.aspx).
Doesn't sound too different from [how I have my Media Center stuff set
up](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx)
except he's using [MyMovies](http://www.mymovies.dk) to list the titles
and I'm using the built-in Media Center movie library.
