![The B-52s play the Oregon Zoo. Yes, this is a horrible picture. Trust
me, it's
them.](https://hyqi8g.bl3302.livefilestore.com/y2pt8gp1EJjZRWRkgdatD1DXgxOSzu95_1IWnED0lUv5UGfFunqMPkAHZw7xNw3QSpurkkCPXlJHSMC80SIwTddx5esSBz60-VKWLaIKcB9M6I/20090622b52satzoo.jpg?psid=1)Jenn
and I went on a little adventure on Friday night and saw [The
B-52s](http://theb52s.com/) live at [the Oregon
Zoo](http://www.oregonzoo.org/). The zooÂ has [a pretty awesome concert
series](http://www.oregonzoo.org/Concerts/schedule.htm) going this year
and we figured since we'd never been to a concert at the zoo before,
this would be a good one to start with.

The tickets let us into the zoo at 4:00p, the doors to the amphitheater
opened at 5:00p, and the show started at 7:00p. We got there about 4:30p
and the line was already super long, so I guess now we know - get there
at 4:00p. We still ended up getting decent seats - not awesome, but
decent - about halfway back.

The only real problem was the rain. Between, say, 5:00p and 7:15p it was
raining like a torrential downpour, so Jenn and I were sitting on these
little lawn chairs we brought, huddled under a blue plastic tarp,
sucking down a $25 pizza and a $6 drink. Not a big deal since the
opening band, [The 88](http://www.the88.net/), was okay... but not
awesome. (It reminded us a little of [the Paul and Storm song "Opening
Band."](http://www.paulandstorm.com/lyrics/opening-band))

Then The B-52s came out and the rain stopped (or, at least, kept to a
very, very light drizzle), and people stood up and danced. As much as
you can "dance" in the middle of a soaked-out zoo amphitheater, that is,
so it was more standing and bobbing up and down. But there was
definitely movement.

They totally rocked. I'm a latecomer to the whole B-52s thing, so the
stuff I'm most familiar with is off the *[Cosmic
Thing](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002LGY?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000002LGY)*
album and a few of the radio hits. They played some that I wasn't
familiar with but liked a lot so I ended up doing a little Amazon spree
to get a few of the earlier albums. [Kate
Pierson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Pierson) still has it and is
still one of my favorite voices, and [Fred
Schneider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Schneider) with his
unmistakeable [sprechgesang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprechgesang)
style is just fantastic.

Their part of the show ran, oh, maybe an hour and a half, then they were
done, but it was a great 90 minutes. Hearing "Love Shack" and "Rock
Lobster" live was worth the price of admission. "Knock a little louder,
Portland!"
