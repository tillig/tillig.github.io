Saturday Jenn and I went out house hunting with the realtor again. This
time, however, we met with success - we found a *beautiful* house that
had everything we wanted. We walked through and loved everything about
it. Very spacious, beautiful construction, excellent floor plan, lots of
character. Perfect.

 You know when people tell you that when you walk into a house you just
sort of "know" whether that's the house for you? We *knew*. It was
awesome.

 We went through a couple more houses just to make sure, but we couldn't
stop thinking about that one. We decided to make an offer.

 The realtor went back to the office to draw up the paperwork and told
us to go hang out at Starbucks or something for a half hour while things
got prepared.

 Twenty minutes or so later, I got a call from the realtor.

 Someone made an offer *the day before* on our house and it was
accepted. So, from the category "a day late and a dollar short," we were
a day late.

*sigh*...

 I guess we're going to take a day and go through some more this
weekend, but I don't think we have that many now that we want to see. I
know much better what features I'm looking for in a house (at least, I
know all the things about the house we lost that I would like to see in
any future prospects) and none of the ones we have seen so far even come
close.

 So... the search continues. Much to my dismay.

 In related news, our next door neighbors moved out of their apartment
this weekend. It made me very jealous, though honestly I don't know if
they're moving to a house or just another apartment. Either way, I
couldn't help but feel like it should be *me* doing the moving out.
