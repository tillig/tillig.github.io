I've been watching a lot of TV on DVD recently, probably because you can
be more selective about which episodes of which series you want to see
combined with the distinct lack of time-wasting commercials. Found this
site called [TV Shows On DVD](http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/) that tells
you all about the current and scheduled releases of TV on DVD. If you're
into that, it's definitely a site worth bookmarking.

 Now the question is, when are they going to get around to putting
[*Voyagers!*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0083500/) or [*The
Wizard*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0090547/) on DVD?
