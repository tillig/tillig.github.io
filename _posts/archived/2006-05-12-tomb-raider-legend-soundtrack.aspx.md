I've been playing [*Tomb Raider:
Legend*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0XSN6/mhsvortex)
and I love it. Besides the graphics and the game play both being great,
the soundtrack rocks, too. Unfortunately, I don't see them selling it on
CD, but [there's a place where you can download
it](http://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/tr7/soundtrack.html).
