I've been on a mission for spare parts for this RC helicopter I got. A
mission, I tell you! I found [the manufacturer in
China](http://www.hongxintoys.com/) (good luck tracking that down), I
called the store where my dad bought it... all to no avail. Spare parts
don't seem to be locally available, and shipping them from China
directly in the quantity I'd have to purchase in would be more expensive
than just buying a new chopper.

 So... I guess it's time for a new chopper. Maybe something just
slightly higher-end, possibly a three-channel entry-level thing that has
spare parts available. Looks like a trip to [Tammie's
Hobbies](http://www.tammieshobbies.com/) is in order this weekend.
