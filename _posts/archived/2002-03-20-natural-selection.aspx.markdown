I went to [The Wherehouse](http://www.wherehousemusic.com/) today to get
my fill of Tom Jones, as I mentioned I had a craving for yesterday. Let
me state now, for the record, that The Wherehouse has a *pathetic
fucking selection of Tom Jones albums*. The only one (yes, *one*) they
had was an *old* greatest hits album. And they only had one copy of
that! Unbelieveable.

 As you can tell, I'm a little irritated over the whole thing. What this
basically amounts to is that now I have wait until Friday and head over
to [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/) on employee double-discount
day and *hope* that they have a better selection than The Wherehouse
did. And pay full price, at that, since The Wherehouse had no used
copies of Tom Jones stuff, either.

 I suppose having no used Tom Jones albums implies something about Tom
Jones fans and their retention of his records. Score another point for
ol' Tom.

 On a whole different topic, you know how you go to the [Microsoft
Support website](http://support.microsoft.com/) and search their
Knowledge Base and the articles are all numbered like "Q123456" and
stuff? Well, after working with the developer support team on an issue
for, like, months now, I finally have a resolution to a [SharePoint
Portal Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/) memory leak I
found, and they're going to put a Knowledge Base article in about it!
When it's out, it'll be Q319472. I'll put a link in here when I find it,
which should be in a week or so. I'm stoked. (No, it won't have my name
in it or anything, but I'll know it was ***me*** who found the
problem!)Â  [UPDATE: [It's
out!](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319472/en-us)]

 And, in the world of [Liberty
City](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/)... Last night I
played chauffeur for a mob boss's girlfriend and gunned down a bunch of
Triad guys. The missions are getting a lot harder now. I thought I was
doing pretty well on the "drive this person around for a while"
missions, but now I'm having to get out and gunfight... I can't wait
until I get the sniper rifle. The gun combat in that game is a little
difficult.

 Oh, and I felt sort of good when Business 2.0 declared the movie
*Freddy Got Fingered* as one of the [101 Dumbest Moments in Business for
2001](http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,38604|5,00.html).
Call me crazy.
