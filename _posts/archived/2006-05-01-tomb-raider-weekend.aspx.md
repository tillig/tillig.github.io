Saturday was an errand day (running around to various stores, picking
things up as needed, general taking-care-of-business) followed by a bit
of evening gaming with [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), but
Sunday... Sunday almost all day was dedicated to [*Tomb Raider:
Legend*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0XSN6/mhsvortex). I
think I must have played for six hours. They really did an awesome job
with it and I'm having a great time.

 In other news... I should shortly have a new version of
[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
out that will not only let you preview the XML doc but will also preview
the member syntax box inline with the doc, just like the NDoc output.
I've got some folks doing some testing for me to make sure it doesn't
break anything, but that should be done soon. I'll keep you posted.
