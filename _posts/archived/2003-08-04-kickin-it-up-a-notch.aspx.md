Well, folks, things seem to have worked out reasonably well for me
today. I have:

-   Passed my Windows Application Programming in C# test
-   Moved my site over to my friend [Marty's](http://www.mildperil.net)
    box
-   Not eaten anything but [Sour
    Skittles](http://www.skittles.com/products/sour.jsp) all day long

**The Test:** I actually thought I failed this while I was taking it.
Seriously. There were 58 questions, and only around 35 of them were on
my practice test. The rest were pulled out of someone's ass and I had
*no clue* on them. Obviously I'm a skilled guesser (thank God they're
multiple choice tests) because I passed. Honestly, I don't care *how* I
passed, as long as I did. So, moving on to the next test, right?

 **The Site:** If you're here reading this, you can see that the site
move went acceptably. I've put up a redirector page for folks whose name
servers haven't updated to the new location. Hopefully that will
propagate through within the next day or three. Regardless, I'm here
now, with some ample breathing space, meaning I can post pictures of my
stupid neighbors and their fucking Titanic car parked in the fire lane
and all the other shit that gets my goat. I'm stoked, and you should be,
too.

 **Sour Skittles:** I think they speak for themselves. Though I should
probably take some time and eat something substantial.

 All in all, not a bad day. Now maybe I should get some *work* done...
