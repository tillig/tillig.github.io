[I did a little
research.](http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/products/nzcbs/cultivars/chinotto/)
Apparently, "Chinotto" is a dwarf bitter orange.

 I popped open a Chinotto drink just now because I decided it was time.

 I just figured out where Sanbittèr gets its primary
[flavor](/archive/2003/02/24/san-pellegrino.aspx).

 The thing is, Sanbittèr is a very much distilled-down, strong version
of Chinotto. I don't mind Chinotto so much (though I'm not going to get
any more; I'll stick to Limonata), but Sanbittèr is kind of icky.
