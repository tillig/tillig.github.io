On the way back in to work from the car dealership this morning, Jenn
called me to tell me that, prior to calling Comcast to complain about
crappy DNS, she fired up the computer.
 
 Everything works fine.
 
 I'm hoping they fixed whatever was wrong and that's that. But I'm
prepared to go home tonight and find it down again. It never fails,
right?
