I got home on Friday night to find that FedEx had dropped my Playstation
off... with my *neighbors*. And not just any neighbors, but the ones who
[park in the fucking fire
lane](/archive/2003/08/25/parking-in-the-fire-lane.aspx).
 
 Jenn tried to get them to answer the door twice, but had no luck. Their
TV was on far too loud for anyone to hear the door.
 
 I got home, rang their doorbell (they've installed one themselves; our
apartments don't come with doorbells) and a few minutes later the door
opened and I was *accosted* by the stench of freshly pissed pants. I
have no idea how they live in that, but it almost knocked me out. Only
my dire need for my Playstation kept me conscious.
 
 The lady of the house gave me my package (it took her a second to
remember that, yes, just a few hours ago she did, in fact, sign for a
package) and, after making sure it wasn't going to pollute the air
supply in my apartment, I returned upstairs to unpack my console.
 
 I took it straight into my room and opened the box. I pulled out the
work order description and it seems Sony saw fit to replace the entire
laser component in the unit. Fine with me, man. I hooked it up and put
in *Time Crisis 3*, the game I was having trouble with in the first
place.
 
 It still doesn't work.
 
 I tried it all different ways, but it doesn't work. Other games work,
and I even watched a movie on it (which didn't work too well before),
and that works. Everything works *except* this game.
 
 What's puzzling me now is that the game worked for me for a while, but
stopped. It worked for my friend/boss Greg (on his newer hardware
version of the PS2). So is it a disc problem or a hardware problem? I
have to assume it's the disc now, since everything else works and it's
been freshly repaired.
 
 I've now sent a note to Namco support to see if I can package up my
disc and send it in for a replacement. Hopefully I can get my
replacement disc and try that out before my 90 day limited warranty on
the console repair runs out. If the replacement disc doesn't work, then
it'll be confirmed a problem with the console. If it works... well, at
least I have a new laser component in my console, right?
