The [InnoTech Oregon conference](http://www.innotechconference.com/pdx/)
is going on April 16 and 17 at the Portland Convention Center. I'll be
speaking in the Developer track on "Unit Testing with TypeMock."

> Unit testing checks the behavior of the code you write by testing just
> that code, isolated from the rest of the system. It’s complementary to
> integration testing and is an important step toward ensuring
> reliability of the entire system in production. Unfortunately, not
> everything is designed with testability in mind. Third-party
> dependencies can throw a wrench in the works. You may need to add
> tests for legacy code that isn’t easily isolated. And what if the
> public-facing methods and properties on your code make it easy to use
> but hard to test? This session will show you how to have your unit
> testing cake and eat it, too, using NUnit and TypeMock.

I'm the last session of the last day - April 17, 3:30p - so if you want
to see some [TypeMock Isolator](http://www.typemock.com) in action, come
check it out.
