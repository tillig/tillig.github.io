I finished up everything on my Halloween costume except for the hem on
the bottom. It's looking really good. I put buttons in instead of Velcro
as the closure (a Velcro closure? how cheesy), and it makes all the
difference. Thank goodness for automatic buttonhole makers on sewing
machines.

forgot to post this last week, but this guy at work has one of the
original Minis. It's very cool, and I'm admittedly jealous.
 
 Friday I went DVD shopping with my dad and bought a crapload of stuff.
I got [*A Christmas Story* (20th Anniversary
Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AYJUW/mhsvortex),
[*National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation* (Special Edition with
ornament)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS6R/mhsvortex),
[*The Osbournes* Season
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A2ZSN/mhsvortex), [*The
Italian
Job*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B1OFL/mhsvortex),
[*The Matrix
Reloaded*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AXE8I/mhsvortex),
and [*Strange
Brew*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FDCT/mhsvortex). I
also picked up [*Resident Evil: Dead
Aim*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009KO3N/mhsvortex) for
PS2, a game that will work with my GunCon 2 controller. Jenn got the
[*Lion King* collector's
set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008XEOI/mhsvortex). All
in all, quite the haul.
 
 I was going to write more, but I've taken like four hours to type this
out because I'm fighting fires with our extranet domain controller, so
I'll have to get back to it later.
