Cold coffee (not *iced*, just plain *cold*) has to be one of the
grossest things *ever*. I see now why they sell those mug warmer things
that you can plug in to keep your coffee hot.
 
 I tried to schedule an oil change for my car this weekend, but the
dealership is all booked up so I gotta wait until next weekend. Figures.
They *do* have little things of touch-up paint, though, for \$5, so I
will probably pick one of those up this weekend so I can fix a couple
little rock chips I've got on the rear of the car.
