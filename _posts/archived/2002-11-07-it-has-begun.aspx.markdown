 ***It's there! It's there!***
 
 I'm stoked. In case you didn't already know. I shall be playing a bit
of the old ultraviolence tonight with [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice
City*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000696CZ/mhsvortex)!
 
 While we happen to be on my current favorite topic, I have been
listening to the [soundtrack box
set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006SM6Q/mhsvortex)
continuously and have arrived with some critiques:
 
There are several great songs on there, but in some cases, the song on
the album is not, in my opinion, the best song by that artist. For
example, Spandau Ballet's *Gold* is on the album, while everyone knows
damn well that Spandau Ballet's big hit was *True*.
There is a certain underrepresentation of the mainstream. By that I
mean: where are the songs by Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac, Cyndi Lauper,
Wham!, and Madonna? None of those entities are represented on this set,
and I think they should be.
 
 Aside from that, I still recommend the whole set. I'm diggin' it
hardcore.
 
 One random thought to post at the end, here: I saw a
[Schwan's](http://www.schwans.com/) truck today and realize that they've
been delivering groceries to your door since 1952. I wonder if
[HomeGrocer](http://www.homegrocer.com/) and such services feel like
they've been beaten to the punch?
