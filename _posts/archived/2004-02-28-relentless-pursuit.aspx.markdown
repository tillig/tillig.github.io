Tomorrow Jenn and I will be going to check out three more houses and see
if anything compares with "the one that got away." They all seem
reasonably promising, I'll just have to remind myself not to go in with
any preconceived notions.
 
 In the meantime, my parents, who haven't actively been looking for
anything in particular, seem to have found their ideal townhouse out of
nowhere and my father is now trying to figure out how to get them into
it as soon as possible. I'm happy for them, but I continue to be aghast
at the idea of moving out of a disconnected house into a situation where
you're going to have neighbors. Just this evening, Jenn and I were
laughing in our room when the guy next door started pounding on the
wall. Apparently we were being too loud or something (of course, his
alarm will go off and wake us up on the weekend at 5:30a, so his opinion
doesn't hold a lot of water with me). I think they've forgotten what
that's like. Oh, well. I guess this is one of those situations where you
let them make their own mistakes.
 
 Either way, I'm happy for them, but at the same time, I'm pissed off
that I've been totally searching for a while now and haven't had any
luck, while they just stumble across their dream home. Where's *my*
dream home?
