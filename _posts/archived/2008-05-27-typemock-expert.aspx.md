[![Typemock
Expert]({{ site.url }}/images/typemockexperteg1.gif)](http://www.typemock.com/experts.html)I
am fortunate enough to have been named a [Typemock
Expert](http://www.typemock.com/experts.html).

What does that mean? In their words...

> Typemock Experts are independent developers, architects, trainers, and
> other professionals who provide a vital link between Typemock and the
> developers' community. They write books, articles or blogs on a wide
> range of topics, from pragmatic unit testing to development
> methodologies.

Thanks, [Typemock](http://www.typemock.com)! (And if you're not in the
[Typemock community](http://www.typemock.com/Community.php) yet, what
are you waiting for?)
