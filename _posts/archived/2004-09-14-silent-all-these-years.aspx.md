I've been quiet around here for about a week, but that's just because
I've been busy doing stuff I don't remember too well. Don't worry, I'm
not neglecting the site.

 I went to a [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) game this past
Friday and, following that, a meet-and-greet with the team. We won,
which is really good and I hope is a sign of things to come. I was
impressed by a couple of the new guys on the team.

 I don't remember what I did Saturday. I know I worked on painting my
upstairs bathroom (which ended up getting finished Sunday, minus some
small touch-ups that need to be done). I'm sure it'll come to me later.
I know I should have written it down.

 Sunday I was pretty much free so I called a friend of mine I hadn't
talked to for a while to try to get together with him... but I just got
the voicemail. Instead, I bought Jenn a copy of [*Burnout
3*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002IQC8E/mhsvortex) for her
birthday and we played that.

 I also picked up a copy of the [*Saturday Night Live: Best of
Christopher
Walken*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002I84EE/mhsvortex)
disc. I'm a huge Christopher Walken fan... but somehow I remember these
skits being funnier than they were. Maybe they didn't choose an
appropriate "best of," or maybe their idea of "best" differs from mine.

 Yesterday I got the stitches taken out of my side where I had a mole
removed a couple of weeks ago. Everything is healing up fine and the
mole wasn't cancer, which is good (though I never thought it was... I
have a theory this particular doctor, while smart, is trying to make a
buck by hypothesizing about cancerous moles).

 My next couple of weekends look to be pretty booked up. There's a
company picnic coming up this weekend (here's hoping for good weather),
then next weekend there are two birthday parties to go to - my
grandfather's 80th and a friend's 30th. Plus the usual housework crap
that always waits until the weekend.

 I've got some lawn patches that I may have to deal with soon. I'm
thinking it'll involve getting a bag of top soil, cutting "holes" in the
lawn, and patching over the fresh top soil. The soil around my house
sucks - beneath the sod they laid down when the lawn was put in is a
layer of clay, then gravel. Lame. Makes it hard to keep stuff going, let
me tell you. We've also got to get some sort of ground cover (barkdust,
gravel, etc.) in because the weeds are taking over. We do our best to
keep on top of them, Jenn and I, but it's an uphill battle.
