In our fervent [*Guitar Hero
II*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MRNUB2?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000MRNUB2)
playing, Jenn's whammy bar has gotten slightly loose.  (Yeah, that
sounds dirty.)

Anyway, I thought that one way to fix it would be to get one or two tiny
o-rings, put them around the whammy bar, and push them down as far as
they'd go to create friction between the whammy bar and the guitar. 
Hey, it's worth a shot.  (I've also contacted RedOctane to see if they
have some suggestions.)

So I headed over to the local Home Depot and noticed they had like 20
different sizes of o-ring.  I made a guess at the size I needed and
picked up a pack of 10 rings (you can't just buy one, and a pack only
costs like $2).

I guessed wrong.  They were too small.

I went back later that day and got the next size up.  Too big.

So I went online this morning and started looking at o-rings.  First, I
had no idea that there is a whole size scale for o-rings called
"AS568A."  [There are standard number codes that represent the possible
sizes you can get.](http://www.allorings.com/size_cross_reference.htm)

Then, when you want to buy o-rings online, you can't really just search
for "o-rings" - you need to search for "industrial supply."  Turns out
most industrial supply places won't sell to consumers, and many that do
offer you the awesome shipping options of "same day" or "next day,"
which, for a $2 pack of o-rings, costs about $20.  Oh, and buying
o-rings at an industrial supply company still only costs around $2 -
$3/pack, *but there are 100 in a pack*, not just 10.

I ended up getting two sizes of ring from
[McMaster-Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/), one of which, I'm sure,
should fit.  And shipping was fairly reasonable at $4.50 for the two
packs of rings.  Hopefully this will fix the whammy bar issue, but I can
tell you right now I've learned far too much about o-rings.
