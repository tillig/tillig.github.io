We call it "Day 0" because technically all I did today as far as
[Devscovery](http://www.devscovery.com) is concerned is travel. Tomorrow
morning is when the conference actually starts.

 The trip up was decent, if a bit on the wet side.
[Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and I drove up together (well, Stu
drove) and we beat both Portland and Bellevue/Redmond traffic, so I'd
call that a success.

 The
[Homestead](http://www.homesteadhotels.com/minisite/default.asp?hotelID=103)
where we're staying is one of those "extended stay" places so there's a
little kitchenette and they offer wireless Internet (hence my ability to
blog and check email, albeit on a weak 802.11b signal) for $4/stay.
It's a little... dicey... though. I mean, there's sort of this
mysterious stain on the carpet, and there's no shampoo in the room even
though there's soap... No little disposable plastic cups, but some
actual plastic...ware... cups. But no dish soap, and like I'm going to
use those cups without washing them out myself.

 Oh, well. I'll be here for the next couple days, so I'd best get used
to it.

 Luckily I brought my PS2 and went to Radio Shack to get an RF converter
thing so I can hook it to the primitive video display box they have in
the room. Stu and I watched far too much Strong Bad email on DVD.

 And now it's bed time. I'll catch up on my email, then hit the hay.
Tomorrow: .NET!
