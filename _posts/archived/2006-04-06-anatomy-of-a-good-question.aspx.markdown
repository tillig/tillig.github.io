Another thing we learned in my [peer mentoring
class](/archive/2006/03/30/peer-mentoring-seminar.aspx) was that there
are such things as stupid questions.
 
 That sounds bad, but let's look at that: what constitutes a stupid
question? Well, if you flip it around, what constitutes a good question?
A good question is one in which the person asking the question has
really thought the question through, they've tried to answer it
themselves, and they have a good grasp on what they're asking - they've
put some effort into the formulation of the question. So, then, a stupid
question is when the person asking doesn't think at all about the
question, they just blast it out there.
 
 What shows me that you've thought about a question? That's different
for different people, but when you ask me a question, especially if it
involves me having to stop what I'm doing to answer, here's what I want
to know:
-   **Priority**: Is this super-urgent, or are you just asking out of
    curiosity? If it's not crisis level and I'm busy, maybe you should
    save it for later.
-   **Time To Answer**: How long do you think it's going to take me to
    answer? More than two or three minutes (from the time you start
    asking the question to the time I finish answering) and you might
    want to block off some time in Outlook.
-   **Concise Description of Problem**: Can you ask the question in one
    or two sentences (including enough context to make the problem
    understandable)? If not, stop and think through what you're asking.
-   **What You Expect**: What are you looking for from me? Advice? A
    technical direction? Just someone to vent to?
-   **Who Else You Asked**: If you asked other people the question
    first, are they still working on it? Did they give you any
    additional information?
-   **What You've Done**: What have you done already to try to answer
    the question yourself?
-   **When You Need It**: Do I have to answer right now or can I get
    back to you?


 Much of this goes hand in hand with the use of [correct communication
protocol](/archive/2006/03/30/my-interaction-preferences.aspx). If you
bug a person too much and/or in the wrong fashion, you're not going to
get a great response.
 
 I'll also throw out two more tips, specifically for people asking me
questions:
-   **Do not start your question with "I have a quick question."** I'll
    determine if it's quick or not based on the amount of time you think
    you need. Instead, try "I have a one-minute question" or "I have a
    two-minute question." Make sure your time estimate is accurate -
    don't say you have a two-minute question if it's a fifteen-minute
    question. Don't tell me you need one minute when you really need
    five.
-   **Do not show up and drop your laptop on my desk.** I know you may
    want me to review some code or look at something. The fact that you
    had to bring your laptop over already tells me you're over the
    one-or-two-minute limit on drop-in questions and you need to
    schedule some time in Outlook. Nothing is more frustrating than
    "\*bam\* Hey, can you look at this?" Seriously.


 I think I'm going to try this out on a larger scale. If folks at work
have questions, I'm happy to answer them, as long as they're *good
questions*.
