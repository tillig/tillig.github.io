I woke up this morning and saw the Tub Cat was in the Christmas spirit,
so I figured it was time for me to get there, too.

 As such, I decided to send out a quick email pseudo-personal card to
folks that I talk to and folks that I don't normally get a chance to
talk to and catch up with people. A few might be coming in to check out
the site, even, which would be cool. (Plus, I get to see who has changed
their email addresses and NOT TOLD ME. I'm already getting bounces.)

 I've gotten a comment already on how sad this tree looks. A little
background there... It's a small, plastic tree that we're using as a
test for our Tiny Cat (not pictured). We want to see how well she
handles this tree - how many times she knocks it over, how much of it
she eats, etc. - so we can determine what kind of tree we could get next
year. Every morning we wake up to the more plastic pine needles all over
the floor, so the chances of getting a nicer, larger tree next year are
not looking good.

 I'm in training next week, so I'm out of the office. The following two
[holiday] weeks, I'm on vacation, so I'm out of the office. What that
yields is not unlike a month-long mini-sabbatical from work. The
anticipation is killing me. Freedom from the ridiculous commute. Freedom
from the daily grind. I can hardly wait.

 Of course, I'll be missing the company outing to [*Lord Of The
Rings*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/) next week, but I suppose
that's the price I pay. If I was on vacation, I'd actually come back
just to see the movie... but I'm in training, and I can't really skip
out on that. It's for my last MCSD test, and I want to get it over and
done with.

 I'll do my best to continue posting to the blog while I'm out, but
don't expect daily updates. I mean, I'm on vacation for goodness sake.
What do you expect?
