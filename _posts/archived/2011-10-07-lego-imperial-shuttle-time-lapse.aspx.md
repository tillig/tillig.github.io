A while ago I did a time lapse video of me building [the Lego Imperial
Shuttle kit](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041I0N9A?tag=mhsvortex) and I
thought I blogged it, but I guess not. Hmm.

It took about 11 hours to build and I got it down to about three minutes
in the film. I'm really pleased with the model - really well done and
nice quality. I have it sitting on my desk at home now.

If you want to see it better, open it up full screen in HD.
