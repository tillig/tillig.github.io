Well, gang, I'm out of here for a week (I'll be at home playing [*Grand
Theft Auto: Vice
City*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000696CZ/mhsvortex) if
you need me).
 
 It's my first vacation in a long time, so it'll be good. I'll be
getting my cat declawed and spayed, but the primary reason for this one
is *the playing of the game*.
 
 A quick link before I go: For those who loved the old Atari games,
check out [this product from
Avon](http://shop.avon.com/avonshop/product.asp?pf_id=3870&department=search&find_spec=atari).
10 classic Atari games, all packed into an Atari joystick that plugs
right into your TV! And *only \$20!!!*
 
 I may have to get one of these.
