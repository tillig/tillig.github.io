I played around with my PS2 some more last night and it turns out I'm
not only having trouble with *Time Crisis 3*, but also *SSX3* and *SSX
Tricky* (among others). So while the console plays DVD movies now, it
plays *fewer* games than it did before I sent it in.

 I called Sony and I'm going to send them back my console and they're
going to send me a new, working unit. Postage paid and all! So while
it's been a pain to have to deal with it, Sony seems to have done their
best to make things right, which, again, is better than I can say for
most technical support situations I've been in. No fighting, no hassle.

 Unfortunately, I think that means I'm going to be PS2-less for the
holiday season unless they can get their shipping on. I suppose that's
okay. It'll give me a chance to catch up on movies and reading, and
maybe even install a \*gasp\* PC game or three. I have a load I've been
wanting to try, I just haven't gotten to it. Now that I have a new PC,
there's no reason not to.
