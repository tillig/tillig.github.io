Sometimes you're presented with a moment in time for which you want to
remember where you were, what you were doing. I think the inauguration
of Barack Obama, our 44th president, is one of those moments.

I watched the inauguration on the TV in the CheckFree Hillsboro lobby,
drinking a red Amp, standing with my team and some of the other
employees. It was a powerful event to watch and I look forward to the
coming years to see how he does. I have a lot of hope.

Where were you for the inauguration?
