So I just installed [Windows Live Writer
2009](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) and I'm posting from
there. I wasn't super impressed last time I used WLW (which was,
admittedly, a while ago) so I'm hoping this is better.

So far, it is. I'll post my next few posts with this and see how it
goes.

One thing that would be nice would be an ImageShack plugin so I can
upload pictures to that rather than directly to my blog. (Saves on
bandwidth, right?) Did a quick search and didn't find anything. I
suppose if I like WLW and use it, I should probably write the plugin,
eh?
