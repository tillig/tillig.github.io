I know it's bad news to release things on Friday right before the day is
out, but I can't hold it in any longer:

I am pleased to announce that after a far-too-long silence,
[**CR\_Documentor 2.0.0.0 has been released and is now available for
download**](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/).

Three major things to report in this release:

1.  **All reported bugs have been fixed.** If you mailed me or left a
    comment about a bug, it should be resolved in this release. While
    there are [some known
    issues](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/wiki/KnownIssues),
    things should render right and it should behave itself reasonably.
2.  **Sandcastle "Prototype" preview style is available.** You can
    choose between the classic NDoc preview style or the new Sandcastle
    "Prototype" style.
3.  **The plugin is now open source.** I've [created a new home for the
    plugin on Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/) and
    have released it under the Apache 2.0 license. I'd love to get some
    help and contributions on it, but even if you're just curious about
    how it works under the hood, feel free to grab the code.

All the info - FAQ, known issues, etc. - is all on [the new
CR\_Documentor site at Google
Code](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/), as is the download. Head
on over and check it out!
