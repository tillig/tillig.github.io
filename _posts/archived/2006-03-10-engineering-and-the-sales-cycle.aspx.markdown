It really annoys me how (at least, in my experience) the sales cycle
seems to trivialize the value of product development engineers. I can't
tell you how many times I've heard someone say, "If it wasn't for Sales,
we wouldn't be drawing paychecks." Guess what - *if Sales had no product
to sell, they wouldn't be drawing paychecks either*.
 
 I also find it pretty annoying how Sales (again, in my experience) can
sell a feature that doesn't exist on a product that isn't complete and
somehow it's the engineer's fault for "not having that done on time."
Hey, man, I can run out and sell a flying car fueled by water, but
anyone will tell you I haven't got a leg to stand on when I bitch out
General Motors asking why that isn't quite done yet because the customer
is expecting it.
 
 One of these days someone will figure out that Sales and Engineering
actually need to co-exist. Neither is more important than the other.
Engineering needs to react to the needs that the Sales folks have - when
a feature needs to be added to a product, that information needs to be
seriously considered by Engineering (before it gets sold to a customer).
Sales needs to stop promising things that Engineering can't deliver and
then turning around and blaming Engineering for not delivering something
that can't be delivered.
 
 Until then, though... I'm thinking I need to put up some [concertina
wire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concertina_wire) around my cubicle.
