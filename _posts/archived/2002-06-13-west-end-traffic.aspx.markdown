I will never understand the traffic on the west side of Portland. It
seems that no matter what time of day it is, it's rush hour on the West
Side. I'd blame it on the weather, but that wouldn't make any sense
because the thought pattern of the average West Side driver would be
"Oh, my, it's raining out! Better slow down!" *and* "Oh, my, it's sunny
out! Better slow down!" It makes no sense. I could go further with a
discussion of [how to
merge](/archive/2002/04/02/a-public-safety-announcement.aspx) onto the
freeway, but [I've already done
that](/archive/2002/04/02/a-public-safety-announcement.aspx) once
before, so I don't think I need to go into it again.
 
 The reason I bring it up is because yesterday it took me well over an
hour to get home and I only live *15 miles from work*. That means that,
basically, I travelled an average of 15 miles per hour. I could
technically have driven home in *first fucking gear* and it would have
gotten me there in the same amount of time. No sense whatsoever.
 
 I'm starting to think the West Side city planners don't actually
*reside* on the West Side. They screwed everything up as a big joke on
the poor souls who have to commute that direction every day. It used to
be where the traffic going *into* Portland in the morning and *leaving*
at night was way worse than the traffic travelling in the opposite
direction. Not so anymore; now it's all just terrible.
 
 The [Oregon Department of Transportation](http://www.odot.state.or.us/)
has a [series of traffic cameras](http://www.tripcheck.com/) that allow
you to see what's going on. [Here's the series that defines my
commute](http://www.tripcheck.com/roadcams/customcamdetail.asp?Name=Trav%27s%20Commute&Num=3&cam1=49&cam2=63&cam3=78).
Check it out in the morning and the evening; you'll see what I mean.
 
 On another note, my copy of *[Real
Genius](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065U1Q/mhsvortex)*
should be here today, or maybe tomorrow. That shipped with [*Lexx*
Series 3 Vol.
1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000633QM/mhsvortex), [*Lexx*
Series 3 Vol.
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000633QN/mhsvortex), and
[*Buffy the Vampire Slayer* Season
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063IOT/mhsvortex). I'm
stoked for that stuff to get here. I haven't seen *Real Genius* forever.
I'll have to bring it and play it at work.
 
 Speaking of DVDs, I'm a little irritated that they haven't put the
movie *[Electric Dreams](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0087197)* out on DVD
yet. It's out of print on video, too (you can buy it for like \$75 in
some places, but give me a break). The soundtrack was good on that one,
too. Highly recommendable.
 
 Jenn's a little pissed that the new *[Grand Theft Auto: Vice
City](http://www.rockstargames.com/news/)* game is coming out. Sorry,
baby. Some things just have to happen, you know? :)
