I've added another new category - Code Snippets - for little pieces of
code I come across or use that I think might be helpful to folks. Not
really Geek Moments, not really Tech Support. Sorry to the casual
readers who don't care about code. I don't really have anywhere else to
publish this stuff, so everyone gets to see it.
