I stayed late after work last night to try and get some help with my
[SendTo menu
project](/archive/2004/08/26/it-just-works-mixed-mode-pinvoke-or-com.aspx).
Talked to a guy smarter than me at C++ and, while he gave me some ideas
as to what I should test, the problem still isn't solved, so I still
can't tack the SendTo menu into the Visual Studio .NET solution
explorer.
 
 Interfacing with the Windows shell shouldn't be this hard. I mean, I'm
a smart guy. I'm no [Raymond Chen](http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/),
but I'm a smart guy nonetheless. I just don't think it should be this
difficult. In a day and age where the rough stuff is abstracted away by
managed code and garbage collection, someone much smarter than me should
have already figured this out and fixed it by now.
 
 I guess I'll keep trying. Seriously, though, if anyone knows of someone
who understands shell programming in C++ (and, hopefully, also knows
managed extensions for C++) and would like to fix this thing for a
little piece of fame (no fortune, sorry... maybe a six-pack of your
favorite beverage?), let me know. You'll be helping the world as we know
it.
