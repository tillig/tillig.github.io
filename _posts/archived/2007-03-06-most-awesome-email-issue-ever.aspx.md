Due to the stupid [server down issue I had a bit
ago](/archive/2007/02/27/site-down-issues.aspx), I got moved to a new
server but it seems that not all my settings made it, so anyone who had
sent mail to any address at paraesthesia.com wasn't getting through to
me.
 
 I just figured it out, and it's only been since, oh, February 27, so
I've only got about 1400 emails to manually filter through and deal
with. But I've got everything fixed again so it should be working fine.
If you sent me something that I should have responded to but didn't,
re-send and I'll answer. ARGH!
