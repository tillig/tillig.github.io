I was wondering if I'd get a Traffic Asshole before the Thanksgiving
holiday, and sure enough, society came through for me.

 Behold: A double-long dump truck doing 20 miles an hour *in the fast
lane*!

 He stayed in the fast lane for probably five miles. Traffic was backed
up way beyond that even. Once you got past him - smooth sailing.

 Thank you, Traffic Asshole, for a nice commute just before the
holidays.
