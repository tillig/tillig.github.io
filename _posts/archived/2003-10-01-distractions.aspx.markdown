I'm working at home today because of the delivery of my new dining room
set (a bar-height bistro table and two stools) which occurred a short
while ago.
 
 I find that, while it's nice to be in a comfortable environment and get
things done, there are too many things around here that I'd rather be
doing, so it becomes difficult to concentrate at times. The cats demand
attention, my Halloween costume needs to get done, things need to be
cleaned...
 
 Anyway, the long and the short of it is, there's merit to working in
the office, since there aren't all of the other things to do. You either
work... or work. Plus, working at home, I could get my schedule too
screwed around. I'd be working at all different hours, some days I'd
skip it, some days I'd live at the computer... who knows how consistent
I'd be?
 
 I think if I did work from home, I'd have to have, like, a home office
or something, somewhere that implies "work" and not "other things to
do." Then maybe.
 
 Of course, I need a *house* first... which isn't happening on the
current paycheck.
 
 Re: my new table, I'm liking it quite a bit. It looks really good. It
sits high (which I like), but that means it's also closer to this stupid
ceiling fan we've got in the dining room (which I don't like), so, since
you're closer to the lights, you're hella hotter. I've unscrwed a couple
of the bulbs so it's not as hot, but now it's sorta dark. Argh! Can't
win for losing.
 
 Jenn's started us on Atkins today, so it's low-carb living for a while.
I guess we'll see how that goes. I know I could stand to lose the gut.
