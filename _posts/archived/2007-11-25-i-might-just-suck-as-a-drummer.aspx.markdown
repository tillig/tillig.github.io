Okay, so for a while I thought it might be that I got [a bum set of
drums](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWd7nTAK0Y) with my copy of
*[Rock
Band](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TT4GBG?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000TT4GBG)*
because I'm only able to get like 98% on Easy level.  I mean, I swear
I'm hitting them right, but it's just not registering.

To test, I went into practice mode and played a song segment that
basically has no drums at all - so I wouldn't get confused by notes
being hit or missed.  I did a roll on each drum to see how it went and
all of the hits were registered.  I also hit various combinations of two
pads simultaneously and all of those hits were registered.  So I was/am
encountering a combination of issues, all adding up to Bad News for Me:

1.  The timing on the drums is utterly unforgiving.  If you're playing
    guitar, you get a little plus/minus room for strumming and hitting a
    note.  Sort of a "close enough" buffer.  With drums, you're either
    ON or you're NOT.  No fudge room.  A millisecond or two off, and it
    won't count.
2.  The USB hub that comes with the game is pretty bad and seems to
    introduce a little latency.  Not a lot, but with timing having to be
    pretty precise, I notice a little better response when I plug the
    drums into the Xbox directly and everything else goes in the hub.
3.  Calibrating the game is hugely important.  Sometimes the presets
    work; I manually calibrated mine and things seemed to be a little
    better.
4.  I may just be a sucky drummer.  After checking out the
    responsiveness of the drums, calibrating everything, and plugging
    the drums right into the Xbox, I'm doing a little better but am
    still missing a couple of notes per song on Easy mode.  It's usually
    during a spot where I have to hit two pads simultaneously and I
    think it's that I'm hitting them close to correctly but actually
    hitting one pad slightly earlier than the other, so it doesn't
    count.

I'm pretty good at [*Donkey Konga*
bongos](/archive/2005/04/17/amped-up.aspx).  I think playing drums with
your hands and playing them with sticks might be two different beasts. 
I'm OK with that - knowing that it means practice is one thing; doubting
yourself without knowing if it's the equipment or not is a whole other
set of insecurities.
