I was just at the local [Haggen](http://www.haggen.com) and bought a
[Nestle Crunch "Mocha" bar](http://www.bradkent.com/cgi-bin/cdb.pl?224).
I'd never had one before, so thought I would give it a shot.

 Buying a bar with the word *Mocha* appended to the name sort of implies
to me a *coffee-esque* flavor.

 Not so.

 After tasting it, I realized I had been duped - the only thing the bar
resembled to mocha was the *color*. It was a nice creamy light-brown
hue, the result of mixing *white chocolate and milk chocolate*. Sweet
like nobody's business, but not at all what I was expecting. Bastards.
