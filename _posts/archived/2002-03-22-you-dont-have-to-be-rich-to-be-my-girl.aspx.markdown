 I am a happy camper.
 
 During lunch I went to [Turn Around
Sound](http://www.digitalcity.com/portland/shopping/details.adp?companykey=111236463),
a local new and used CD store (that is, local to my place of employment)
and found me a copy of *[The Best of Tom
Jones](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000007OWW/mhsvortex)*.
Which, of course, contains his cover of Prince's song, *Kiss*. Oooooh,
yeeeeeah.
 
 I have issued a fair warning to all relevant individuals in my
department (i.e., those adjoining my cubicle) that there is about to be
some serious Tom Jones action going on here and that they should watch
for flying panties lest they be pelted to death.
 
 Tom is now crooning away. I am *stoked*. Of course, I'll still have to
venture forth this weekend to find the
*[Reload](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002G43/mhsvortex)*
album, but for now, I'm good to go.
