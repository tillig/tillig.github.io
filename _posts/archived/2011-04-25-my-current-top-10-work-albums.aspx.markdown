When I'm working (coding) I generally like some sort of music that
either doesn't have any words or is otherwise reasonably peaceful so I'm
not, like, compelled to sing along or something. I also like music that
sort of flows, so stuff that's very dissonant or has an oddly syncopated
rhythm, stuff that has a lot of high-pitched sirens, and so forth...
that's not so much my thing.

The list of what I listen to changes quite a bit - I have a lot of music
- but right now, my top go-to albums for while I'm drumming out some
code are (in no particular order)...

| Album | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [![Mirror's Edge Soundtrack](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tw0w3s1rL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P450LS?tag=mhsvortex) | [**_Mirror's Edge_ Soundtrack**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P450LS?tag=mhsvortex) ([**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002P450LS?tag=mhsvortex)) - I really liked the game and the soundtrack was equally awesome. Only available in MP3 format, but that's fine. |
| [![Tron: Legacy Reconfigured](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Tvo-iArBL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M20YDU?tag=mhsvortex) | [**_Tron: Legacy_ Reconfigured**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M20YDU?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M20YDU?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UOE7VA?tag=mhsvortex)) - The [original version of the soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037KMHRY?tag=mhsvortex) was good, but the remixes take it up a *Whole. Other. Level.* |
| [![Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ADZ7BN4YL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000OTY?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Peter Gabriel - _Secret World Live_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000OTY?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000OTY?tag=mhsvortex)) - This one isn't electronic and it appears to be out of print, or at least, not directly available from Amazon (which is roughly the same thing, right?) but I find myself turning to this one a lot for some calm getting-down-to-work music. |
| [![Imogen Heap - Speak For Yourself](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J3G5pkG4L._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B7BZM4?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Imogen Heap - _Speak For Yourself_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B7BZM4?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000B7BZM4?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001456HMK?tag=mhsvortex)) - I actually discovered this one through [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com) and am now hooked on Imogen Heap. This is my favorite so far, particularly the song "Hide and Seek." |
| [![Massive Attack - Mezzanine](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QWNrevBAL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006045?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Massive Attack - _Mezzanine_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006045?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000006045?tag=mhsvortex)) - You're familiar with this one if you watch *House*. The theme song is "Teardrop" from this album. All the songs are kind of different here (they don't all sound like the same style) so it's there's a little something for everyone. |
| [![Hybrid - Wider Angle](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mW0zShcoL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TOP0ZE?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Hybrid - _Wider Angle_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TOP0ZE?tag=mhsvortex) ([**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TOP0ZE?tag=mhsvortex)) - I like the recorded half of this much more than the live half, but the recorded half just flows. I particularly like "If I Survive," which I originally heard on [the PS2 game *Kinetica*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetica). |
| [![Fluke - Risotto](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dervKpzSL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000024UR9?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Fluke - _Risotto_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000024UR9?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000024UR9?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WW98BS?tag=mhsvortex)) - This has been a long-time favorite of mine. Originally I got hooked on this from [the *Sliver* soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000WJO?tag=mhsvortex) (which is also pretty good). |
| [![Conjure One](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3183K885W0L._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006FSUB?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Conjure One - _Conjure One_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006FSUB?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006FSUB?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TQ0LXG?tag=mhsvortex)) - I have a friend who's brother engineers these guys (that's how I heard about them to begin with). Very cool music, sort of *Enigma*-ish. |
| [![Blue Man Group - Audio](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B9NsoTzaL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000038A2S?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Blue Man Group - _Audio_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000038A2S?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000038A2S?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TERIWA?tag=mhsvortex)/[**DVD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000051S65?tag=mhsvortex)) - Sort of entrancing / hypnotic, which is cool for PVC pipe. The live show is amazing - be sure to go if you get the chance. The DVD to this has a really nice 5.1 surround mix of the music, which isn't too helpful for an iPod or whatever, but is awesome on your home theater. |
| [![Sarah Brightman - Harem](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3159VNBABML._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008W2QZ?tag=mhsvortex) | [**Sarah Brightman - _Harem_**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008W2QZ?tag=mhsvortex) ([**CD**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008W2QZ?tag=mhsvortex)/[**MP3**](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TEMQK4?tag=mhsvortex)) - There is just something about Sarah Brightman that I love. This is one of my favorites and the one I listen to most. There are a couple tracks on here that are a little "meh" but the really good ones outweigh the ones you have to skip. |

I realized after putting this together that I could make this like a
"top 25" list but then... nah. Plus, I switch it up a lot, so these are
what I'm listening to now, but I may get into [an Anna Phoebe
mood](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035VKZZG?tag=mhsvortex) or something
for a week, which would mean this list would change. (I actually started
with a top five and decided that wasn't long enough, so I upped it to
ten.)

Got any awesome recommendations? Leave 'em in the comments!
