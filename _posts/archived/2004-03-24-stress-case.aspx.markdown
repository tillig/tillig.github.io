I'm a stress case. I'm a high-strung, mildly neurotic, anal-retentive,
passive-aggressive stress case.
 
 The house buying thing is causing me stress. I've worked my ass off
packing and arranging funds and getting things coordinated and there's
still so much more to do. The time is going altogether too quickly.
 
 Work is causing me stress. I'm working on one project, which is really
three projects that people are kind of calling one project, all of which
have their own timelines (unreasonable) and goals (conflicting).
Requirements are poorly defined (if, in fact, they are defined);
cross-project dependencies are entirely out of my control (and they're
trying to jerk the carpet out from under me on one particular *key*
dependency); and the whole thing is just moving way too fast for me to
feel in control of my own destiny.
 
 To that end, little things are bothering me now. I get the urge to tell
everyone to just fuck off because I can only deal with one thing at a
time anymore. I'm constantly riding that "last straw line" and it seems
that folks can always just find that one last nerve to step on. I'm
rational enough about the situation to realize that I'm not going to be
able to address any of this rationally in a discussion, nor do I want to
"talk it out" or debate about why things need to be the way they are. I
don't care. I just want shit fixed, I want it to work, and I don't want
it to require my personal time and attention.
 
 I think I need a vacation.
