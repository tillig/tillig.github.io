It's been a while since we had a Traffic Asshole, so I got one for you
today.
 
 I hate traffic accidents. They fuck up traffic for everyone, regardless
of which direction you're traveling or where they are in relation to
you. Why is that? The answer is simple - *Rubberneckers*.
 
 Yes, it's the people who need to slow down and check out what's going
on that end up clogging up the roads like so much shit in the drain. I
wish I had a plunger big enough to take care of the problem, but I
don't. My blog is my plunger.
 
 Let's let the image speak for itself, shall we?

Rubberneckers](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pQA054eTHzsCqu0995eR-D0dlBzIZI50KEPtKi9SPPO25G-SESbW8HvV1D-SunfB9DGEc7I_xlbSjfWYjG41NReitBd4qUhpiuGejWt53Xuc/20031120taotw.jpg?psid=1)
 
 As you can see, we've got an accident on the opposite side of the road,
in the oncoming traffic. We're separated from the oncoming traffic by a
concrete barrier in the center of the road. This same barrier pretty
much obstructs any decent view one might get of anything over there, but
that doesn't deter the myriad rubberneckers (particularly the guy
immediately in front of me) from coming to a *near complete stop* just
to check out what's going on, then *flooring it* to close the 500 meter
gap between him and the car in front of him. Nothing wrong with my side
of the road, just people slowing down to watch the flashing lights.
 
 Absolutely ridiculous.
 
 (That said, the poor quality of the image just goes to show you how
badly I need a better digital camera. I think we could all commiserate
on our traffic woes better in a higher resolution, don't you?)
