They finally released a tool on xbox.com that allows you to [transfer
your downloadable content licenses from one console to
another](http://www.xbox.com/drm). This is huge. I used to have to wait
months (yes, plural) to get this to happen after repair, and people who
bought new consoles (upgrade to Elite?) were out-and-out hosed.

That said, there are some important points they [blog about on the
Gamerscore
Blog](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2008/06/26/drmfixtooltrnsfr.aspx)
and there's [a FAQ about the
tool](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/licensemigration/faq.htm).
The two big points for me:

- **When you get your console repaired by Microsoft, they'll do this
    for you** so you won't need to do it yourself. That's important
    because...
- You can only do this **one time every 365 days**.

Apparently this will work with all content but movies because movies
aren't "download-to-own." I don't rent movies over Xbox Live, so I'm not
too concerned here.

The last time I got my console repaired, which was [about a month
ago](/archive/2008/05/15/getting-xbox-360-number-five.aspx), they did
not automatically transfer the licenses even though they said they
would. I called Xbox Live Support and it took about a week for them to
do the transfer (as opposed to the months it previously took). I'm
gathering that if I get another repair and need the licenses
transferred, this won't be the avenue I'm supposed to take - I'll still
need to call them. **This is more for folks getting new consoles or
getting repairs from non-Microsoft facilities.** That said, now that we
know there's a tool, maybe they can do the transfer right there while
I'm on the phone rather than waiting a week.
