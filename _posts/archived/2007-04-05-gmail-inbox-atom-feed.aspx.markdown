I may be the last to the party on this one, but I just noticed it
through the automatic feed discovery mechanism in IE7 - Gmail has an
ATOM feed of your inbox. Using this URL:
 
[https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom](https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom)
 
 All you need to do is subscribe to it and log in using your Gmail
credentials. That's pretty cool!
