I went to the store and bought a couple of surge protector power strips
last night to clean up some of the cord mess we have going on with the
20 bazillion power strips and cables and crap behind the TV upstairs.

 Unpacked it, unplugged the old power strip, plugged the new one in,
plugged in the cable modem, plugged in the wireless router -

- and *honest-to-God fire* shot out of the surge protector.

 Just as quick, it was out, with a slight puff of smoke coming out the
back of it. It wasn't enough to be really worried about, just enough to
make me scream like a little girl and drop it in fear for my life.

 It also took down one of my circuit breakers, so I had to go downstairs
and flip that back on.

 Guess I'll be taking *that* back.
