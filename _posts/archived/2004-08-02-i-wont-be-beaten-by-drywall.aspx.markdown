Last Thursday I had some drywall contractors in to fix my [bathroom
issues](/archive/2004/07/02/wall-decals.aspx). They sanded, mudded, and
retextured. They told me to wait 24 hours before painting.
 
 Sunday morning I got up, masked everything off, and started painting. I
took care of the high parts (near the ceiling) and Jenn got the middle
and lower parts.
 
 Jenn had *almost finished* when I heard, "Oh my God!"
 
 That's never good.
 
 I went in to find that a baseball-sized chunk of texture had come clean
off the wall and was stuck to the roller.
 
 I guess it wasn't fixed *after all*.
 
 I called the drywall company who, of course, don't have anyone in the
office on the weekend, and left a message to have them call me. If I
don't hear from them by 11:00a or so, I'm calling them back. I won't be
beaten by drywall. I won't. I'll finish painting this bathroom if it
*kills me* (which it probably will).
 
 I won't even get into the fact that we want to [install crown
molding](http://www.altereagle.com/How_to_install.html) in there, too.
With [bullnose corners](http://www.compoundmiter.com/faq.html#bullnose),
no less. I'll have to [measure the
angles](http://www.compoundmiter.com/true_angle_tool.html)... here comes
my high school geometry, back in action.
