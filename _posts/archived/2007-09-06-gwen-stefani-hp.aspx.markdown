[![Gwen Stefani as... a paper
doll.](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pFLlW9MbOxWLJ0LKWVFtPMRNp8L4oTG_1M0GfR9M6fHdGjbcf7H1es4OAglwQBUhLtT9_DGJq_xCnqfRsezc1ch540jrmW0sx5QcBSt4ewBQ/20070906gwendolls.png?psid=1)](http://www.hp.com/gwen)Okay,
so from the department of "Really Weird Marketing Tie-Ins," there's [a

site](http://www.hp.com/gwen) where you can print off Gwen Stefani stuff
- paper dolls, book covers, CD labels, her tour book...Â  Interesting,
but I'm not sure I *get it*.
