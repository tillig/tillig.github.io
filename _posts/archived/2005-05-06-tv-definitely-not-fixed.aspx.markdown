I went in to check out the TV and it's not fixed. I mean, they put a new
tube in, but even the repair technician there says he still sees the
problem and there's nothing else they can do.
 
 I called the warranty company and they tried to foist me off on the
place I bought the TV, but when I explained the situation, they finally
told me that the repair place needs to contact them for "buyout." Not
sure if that means they're going to ship me a new TV or if it means
they're just going to cut me a check. Either way is fine with me, I
think, though the check would be better.
 
 Either way, I was told not to accept delivery of the TV because, well,
there's no point in a broken TV sitting around my house. I concur. Now I
wait. Some more.
