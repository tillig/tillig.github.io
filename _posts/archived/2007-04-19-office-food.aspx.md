I'm not sure whether it's out of necessity or boredom that odd office
food concoctions get generated. I know I've made up some crazy stuff -
some good, some not so good. For example, I know [you can't make Coke
Blak by just combining coffee and
Coke](/archive/2006/08/11/homemade-coke-blak.aspx).

 I think it'd be interesting to compile a list of office-based recipes -
things you can make with the stuff you find around a typical office
(coffee, sugar packets, cup-o-noodles, etc.). I found [a recipe for chai
tea based on office
supplies](http://gadling.blogspot.com/2005/07/after-getting-pissed-off-with-what.html),
though I admit I haven't tried it yet.

 Here are a couple of things I've made (try at your own risk, YMMV):

 **FRUIT PUNCH SODA**
 1 can Sierra Mist (or 7-Up, Sprite, etc.)
 1 packet [Crystal Light
On-The-Go](http://www.kraftfoods.com/crystallight/)
 This is reasonably tasty and a good change from the norm if you like
this sort of thing and your office only carries standard soda flavors.
Pour the can of pop into a cup and pour the packet of Crystal Light into
the pop *slowly*. Stir *slowly* with a stir stick until thoroughly
mixed, pausing when you see the foam start to rise. If you do anything
fast, you're going to have a mess on your hands.

 **MOCHA**
 3/4 mug coffee
 1/4 mug hot water
 1 packet hot chocolate
 2 packets creamer
 Mix contents together thoroughly and enjoy. The water helps to make
chocolate a little more prevalent and make it feel less... *thick*.
Depending on your mood or personal taste, you may just go with the full
coffee/no water approach.

 **ICED TEA**
 1/2 mug hot water
 1 black tea bag
 ice
 Put the tea packet in the mug of hot water and leave it. Freaking
over-steep it. The tea's got to be strong because once you take the tea
bag out, you've got to fill the rest of your mug with ice and let the
ice melt, and that's going to water down the tea. You'll need to
experiment with this one based on personal taste - I like really strong
iced tea, so I leave the tea bag in for a looooong time.

 **SWEET TEA**
 Follow the iced tea recipe but add four to six sugar packets to the tea
before adding the ice. (If you remember your high school chemistry,
[solids generally dissolve better in hot
liquids](http://www.answers.com/topic/solution).)

 If you have a recipe or link to contribute, leave it in the comments. I
think it'd be cool to get a big list of office food recipes.
