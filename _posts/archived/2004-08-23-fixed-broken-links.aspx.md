I think, after having moved hosts twice and blog packages once, I've
finally finished fixing all the broken links and images floating around
here. As such, if you haven't had a chance to really catch up on some of
the better entries, I can't more highly recommend that you [start at the
beginning and check it
out](/archive/2002/02/15/paraesthesia-unleashed.aspx). I've had a good
time reviewing a few of these, but maybe that's more from the sense of a
comedian laughing at his own jokes (which I would do, were I a
comedian).

 I also noticed while going through the past posts that I used to do a
lot more in the way of getting pictures up here, so I think I'l make a
concerted effort at thinking about doing that again. Now that I don't
have a commute, I don't really see Traffic Assholes as much. That said,
it might be good to take pictures of other random stuff I'm talking
about, just to help you guys out.
