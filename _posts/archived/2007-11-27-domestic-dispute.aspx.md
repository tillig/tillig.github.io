Woke up last night at 2:45a to the neighbors out in their yard arguing.
No physical violence, and it was mostly the guy yelling, but *super
loud*.  I don't even think I'd heard them before, except for their dog
barking incessantly a year or so back.  Sigh.

Jenn ended up calling the cops who couldn't actually find our house on a
map.  She kept having to give a bunch of nearby cross-streets and
directions.  That makes me feel really safe.  I imagine a time where
there's a psycho killer in my house trying to stab me and the 911
conversation goes like this:

> **Travis:** Oh my God, help, there's someone in my house trying to
> stab me!  Here's my address - get here as soon as possible!
> **Dispatcher:** Hmmm... you don't seem to be on the map. What's your
> nearest cross-street?
> **Travis:** I think he's coming up the stairs! Wait - cross-street?
> Uh... Foo Ave.
> **Dispatcher:** Yeeeaaaah, um, is that north or south of Bar St.?
> **Travis:** South.  Hurry!
> **Dispatcher:** Are you sure? Where are you in relation to Baz Pl.?
> **Travis:** -stabbed to death-

That's the first time I've called the cops on someone.  When they
finally arrived, it was in *total force* - like, two cars and another
cop running up a side street.  I'm surprised the SWAT team wasn't there.

Had a hell of a time getting back to sleep, though.  It took me forever
to get to sleep the first time, then this.  I'm dead tired today.  Damn,
anyway.
