The commute home sucked. It's only 14.3 miles between work and home, and
it took me an hour and a quarter. That averages out to around 11.5 miles
per hour.

 Here, check this out:

 Traffic backed up as far as the eye could see. Ridiculous. And you know
what it was? An accident coming in the *opposite direction*. Good,
people. Rubberneck. That'll definitely get us home faster.

 Got home, gave Jenn her presents. I got her some movies
([*Amelie*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000640VO/mhsvortex),
[*Pretty
Woman*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305696071/mhsvortex),
and [*Can't Buy Me
Love*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065V3H/mhsvortex)), a
[foot massage

a [Perfect
Pancake](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065DPC/mhsvortex),
and a [sewing
machine](http://www.sears.com/sr/product/details/productdetails.jsp?prod_id=02012049000).
Not a bad haul considering none of her family showed up. Her parents are
out of town for their annivesary and her sister had plans involving
Jenn's niece and a school get together or something. So it was me, Jenn,
and my parents eating tiramisu torte and berry pie. Yum.

 [![Tubby Cat as Gene Simmons (4k

the party, I noticed that the Tubby Cat was doing her best impersonation
of Gene Simmons. She's funny when she does that, and I can't figure out
why. I heard that when cats are content they stick their tongues out.
She must love laying on that paper! Click her head to see the full-body
view.

 Aside from that excitement, it was a nice, quiet evening at home. And
now we're at today, the tomorrow we talked about yesterday, and it's
back to the grinder for me.
