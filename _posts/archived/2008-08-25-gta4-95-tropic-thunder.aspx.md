Two things happened this weekend from an entertainment perspective.

First, I finished getting all of the "hidden packages" and stunt jumps
in *[Grand Theft Auto
4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FRU1UM?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FRU1UM)*,
taking me to 95% completion. It was a bit confusing why I hadn't hit the
100% mark, having completed everything else, but then I found [this 100%
completion checklist](http://www.gta4.tv/100percent.php) and realized I
haven't taken all of my "friends" to do every possible activity. Guess
I'll be doing that this week. (Admittedly, that seems pretty freaking
tedious to contribute towards 100%. *Come on*, Rockstar.)

Second, Jenn and I went with my parents to see *[Tropic
Thunder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942385/)*. It was funny, to be
sure, but I'm not sure which was funnier: the movie, or watching my dad
nearly fall out of his seat laughing at the movie. There was definitely
a lot of random stuff going on in there, and I went in not really
knowing anything about it or what to expect, but it was worth the watch.
Far and away, Tom Cruise was the greatest thing in that movie, though -
*so* over the top.

I still want to see *[Death
Race](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/)*, though. I was totally in
the mood for mindless action but we ended up hitting *Tropic Thunder*
instead. My craving for destruction has not yet been sated.
