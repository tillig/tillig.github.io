[![Grand Theft Auto IV - Special
Edition](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hXYswZDHL._SL220.jpg)](http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=200338)I
gave in and hit the local GameStop during lunch today and pre-ordered my
copy of *[Grand Theft Auto IV - Special
Edition](http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=200338)*.

This version comes with (from the GameStop site)...

-   Grand Theft Auto IV the game with special packaging (a lock box).
-   The Sounds of Grand Theft Auto IV: A selection of our favorite music
    from the soundtrack of GTA IV. This album will only be available
    within the Special Edition package and will feature original tracks
    from some of today's hottest artists.
-   The Grand Theft Auto IV and Rockstar Games Art Book: This will be
    the 1st ever GTA art book to be published by Rockstar Games and will
    feature exclusive art unreleased anywhere else.
-   A Limited edition Grand Theft Auto IV/Rockstar Games bag which has
    been designed especially for this Special Edition
-   An exclusive Rockstar Games keychain to hold your lock box keys.

Yeah, I'm crazy, and yeah, it did cost me \$90... \$30 more than the
game alone.  But I'm a GTA junkie, and they make this crap *targeting me
personally*.  I can't say no.  I'm just as bad as the *Halo* junkies who
will be paying megabucks for the version of *Halo 3* with the mini
replica helmet.

The thing is scheduled to ship on October 16.  If they could guarantee
it would be in my hands on that day, I'd schedule my PTO *right now*.
