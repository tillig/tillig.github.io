A few weeks ago I got [a Motorola Droid
X](http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-X-US-EN).
It didn't start out as well as I'd like.

The first phone I got had a bad pixel on the camera's CMOS sensor that
caused a big pink blotch in the middle of any pictures or video I took.
I returned that one and got a second phone, which had a perfect camera
sensor but a bad pixel on the screen. Third time was the charm, as I
returned the bad screen phone for another that has both a good camera
and a good screen.

Hardware problems aside, I also had a bit of a learning curve to get
over, moving off a BlackBerry Curve, and I ran into some trouble with
connecting to wireless networks reliably. All of this [left me a little
disillusioned](/archive/2010/09/07/technology-trust-issues.aspx) but
I've gotten to a point now where I'm really liking it again.

If you're a new Droid X owner, I thought I'd offer you some tips to help
you skip over the whole disillusioned state. (In some cases, these are
good for any Android-based phone owner, but I can't really speak to
anything but my Droid X experience.)

-   **Test your screen and your camera.** This is pretty easy to do in
    one go. Switch to the camera app and then point the camera at a
    white wall. Look to see if any of the pixels on the screen aren't
    white. Do the same thing against a black surface (or just cover up
    the camera with your finger). If you see an odd pixel (it'll be
    pretty obvious if it's there), then push the volume button on the
    camera to zoom in. If the pixel moves, then the bad pixel is on the
    camera sensor. If the pixel doesn't move, the bad pixel is on the
    screen. If you find a bad pixel, test it a few times to be sure
    before taking it in to the Verizon store. Reboot the phone a couple
    of times and potentially reset the phone to factory defaults and try
    it. (If you don't try the reset, the Verizon store will before they
    let you return it anyway, so save yourself a trip.)
-   **Update to the latest Android version.** They released Android 2.2
    for the Droid X a few days ago but they haven't yet turned on the
    auto-update for it so you have to manually get the latest version.
    Go to **Settings -\> About Phone -\> System Updates** and you can
    get the update. The Android update fixed all the reliability issues
    I was seeing connecting to wireless networks and such. A lot of the
    features are updated and better, too. (After you update, go to the
    Android Market and update your Google Mail app because it's an app
    now, not just a feature of the Android OS.)
-   **Experiment with the power management settings.** Go to **Settings
    -\> Battery Manager** and play around with the different settings in
    there. Pending on how much you use your phone, you can get some
    pretty horrible battery life if you don't fix things up from the
    defaults. I'm still playing with the settings myself or I'd give you
    a recommendation.
-   **Switch to Swype.** The Swype keyboard is way, way, way better than
    the default hunt-and-peck keyboard. Swype lets you basically just
    drag your finger around on the screen keyboard without having to
    push each letter and it magically knows what you were typing. Plus,
    it's free and already installed. Start to create a new text message
    (you won't actually be sending it) and hold down your finger in the
    text field. In the list of options that come up, select "Input
    Method" and then choose "Swype." You won't regret it.
-   **Enable haptic feedback.** With my BlackBerry I had a physical
    keyboard. With an on-screen keyboard you miss the physical feedback
    of a button press. To make up for that, the phone can do a tiny
    vibration when you press an on-screen key on the keyboard. That's
    "haptic feedback" and it's disabled by default because technically
    it eats your battery. It's worth turning on, though - go to Settings
    -\> Sound and check the "Haptic feedback" box to get it.
-   **Don't bother with Task Killers.** In earlier Android phones there
    seemed to be a need to manually kill tasks running on the phone.
    This has hung in the air for a while, but basically the current
    thought is that you shouldn't be using these because it messes with
    the way Android deals with its own task management and can make your
    phone unstable. If you want more detailed information, [this is a
    good
    article](http://geekfor.me/faq/you-shouldnt-be-using-a-task-killer-with-android/).
-   **The Motorola widgets will make it look like your Google account is
    being hacked when it's not.** The phone ships with a nice set of
    widgets you can use on your home screen to display things like your
    calendar or tasks. The problem is that the widgets don't talk
    directly to Google - instead, they ask for the calendar data (or
    whatever) from Motorola and then Motorola talks to Google. Next time
    you log into your Google Mail account through a computer, you'll get
    this awesome red bar at the top warning you that some unauthorized
    behavior has been detected. The address will be something like
    69.10.176.0 (but it may not be exactly that - use your judgment).
    That's the calendar widget doing its thing. You can see more about
    it [on the Motorola Owner's
    Forum](https://supportforums.motorola.com/message/227188).
-   **You may have to reboot.** With my BlackBerry Curve, I really never
    turned it off. Occasionally it would get something weird going on
    and I'd have to do a battery pull. With the Droid X, it's more like
    a computer - if I find something weird is going on or something
    isn't working right, I turn it off and turn it back on again. (After
    the Android update I've not really had to do this, but just be
    aware. No need to reset or battery pull or anything, just turn off
    and on again.)
-   **Get a screen protector.** I've actually had two different ones and
    they both have good and bad aspects. I tried the Verizon one and I
    liked the texture and the fact that it kept fingerprints off the
    screen pretty well, but it was a matte antiglare finish and reduced
    the sharpness of the screen. I'm currently using [a Martin Fields
    protector](http://www.martinfields.com/US/MFOP-MotoDroidX) (which
    also has a camera protector that comes with it) and it is crystal
    clear, covers more of the phone's face than the Verizon one... but
    is a little harder to slide your finger across due to the glossy
    finish and definitely fingerprints up more. Either way, get a
    protector, especially if you thrown your phone in your
    bag/pocket/purse or whatever. (~~Right now if I had to choose, I'd
    go Martin Fields. It's the clearest screen and with the nice screen
    the Droid X has, it's a shame to mute it with antiglare.~~ UPDATE
    10/4/2010: After using the Martin Fields protector for a while, I
    found that the difficulty in sliding my finger caused all nature of
    problems including a few accidentally sent messages and emails as my
    finger stuck at one point on the screen and then sort of "hopped"
    and bumped the "send" button. The Verizon screen protectors, while
    antiglare, allow your finger to slide nicely on the screen, so
    that's what I'm using now.)
-   **Pick either a phone case or the car dock, but you don't get
    both.** They don't tell you this in the store, but it turns out the
    "official" car dock for the Droid X from Motorola won't work with
    any phone cases on the phone. Even the side of the dock box says it
    will, but it won't. This is a well-known issue if you troll the
    forums. Some people were able to get the dock to work with a
    case/cover on the phone by using a Dremel tool in creative ways, but
    I'm not into that. So decide which is worth more to you and go that
    way. (Note the screen protectors mentioned above won't interfere
    with the dock - it's only if you put a case on the phone when you'll
    have problems.) I went with a case since I put the phone in my
    pocket.
-   **Don't set up all of your social media accounts through the "My
    Accounts" app.** Or, at least, be very aware of what you're doing
    when you do this. If you set up, for example, Facebook through "My
    Accounts" rather than just installing the Facebook app from the
    Android Market, it starts trying to synchronize your contacts with
    Facebook and such. At least, it did for me. All hell breaks loose if
    you're trying to manage a clean list of contacts on Google and
    Facebook has incomplete/incorrect/unwanted information in it. Ugh.
-   **Be aware of what permissions applications are asking for when you
    download them.** When you get an app from the Android Market or
    wherever, it'll put up a screen telling you what permissions the app
    is looking for. **Read that screen.** If a card game is trying to
    get access to your contacts or make phone calls, ask yourself why
    it'd need that. Most apps are harmless, but there have been a few
    out there that have been Bad News.
-   **Turn on assisted location.** By default, only the GPS can provide
    your location but the GPS doesn't work indoors well. Go to Settings
    -\> Location and Security and enable "Use wireless networks" and
    "Enable Assisted GPS" so if GPS can't locate you or isn't on, you
    can still get location from network triangulation. (This lets Google
    Maps and stuff work inside when you can't get a GPS signal.) Note
    that the camera app will still complain sometimes that it can't
    locate you. Not sure why this is.
-   **Fix your notification settings.** By default, just about
    everything notifies you of something. When GMail gets a new email it
    sounds a ringtone. New chat message, ringtone. Each app generally
    has the ability to specify how you want to be notified. I turned off
    ringtones and vibration when emails come in but I left the little
    notification icon that appears at the top of the screen. For text
    messages I left the default notification ringtone running, but for
    calendar notifications I made the ringtone something shorter and
    quieter like a little gong because I want to be alerted, but it
    doesn't have to be a fanfare. Your preferences will probably differ,
    just be aware that they exist.
-   **Understand the different volume settings.** There are different
    volumes for incoming calls, notifications, media, in-call voice,
    and... I think that's it. I think. Anyway, just because you turned
    up the volume for one thing doesn't mean all the volumes turned up
    (or down). Go to **Settings -\> Sound** and check out your volume
    settings.
-   **Figure out how to arrange your home screens.** This is actually a
    two-part thing. First, figure out how to add stuff to a home screen.
    What widgets do you have? What do they look like? How do you add a
    shortcut to an application so you can get to it easier? To get
    going, just hold your finger down on a home screen for a couple of
    seconds and watch what happens. There's a lot of cool stuff hidden
    in there that you wouldn't otherwise discover. Second, you have
    seven total home screens you can set up. Think of a plan for each,
    like a "theme" or something. For me, I made them (from left to
    right):
    -   Settings: Settings-related shortcuts, widgets to toggle things
        on and off, and testing applications (GPS Test Plus and Wifi
        Analyzer).
    -   Social and Navigation: [Twitter](http://twitter.com), Facebook,
        Maps, Navigation, Places, and the GPS toggle widget.
    -   Entertainment and Common: Games, the IMDb app, Bluetooth toggle
        widget (so it doesn't have to be on all the time to connect to
        my hands-free set), Wifi toggle widget, and detailed battery
        monitor widget.
    -   Main Home: Calendar widget, Weather Channel widget following
        current location, text message shortcut, browser shortcut, GMail
        shortcut, GTasks shortcut.
    -   Media: Slideshow widget, Camera/Camcorder app shortcuts,
        [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com), Gallery, GPS toggle (camera
        apps use GPS for location tagging).
    -   Contacts: Quick Contact widgets for people I call/mail/text the
        most. Like speed dial, but better.
    -   Shopping: Barcode Scanner, Amazon app, Android Marketplace, etc.

-   **Learn what's up in the Android world.** There are some great web
    sites I follow that provide good information about helpful Android
    apps and other goings-on in the Android world. This is how I learned
    about the Android upgrade being available early.
    -   [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/)
    -   [Android and Me](http://androidandme.com/)
    -   [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com)
    -   [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com)

From there, it's just figuring out apps, widgets, and what you want to
do. It's worth taking the time to explore things. There's a lot of cool
stuff the phone can do, but it's not all immediately obvious, especially
if you've never had an Android phone.
