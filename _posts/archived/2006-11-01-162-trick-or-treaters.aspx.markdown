We rang in at [155 last
year](/archive/2005/11/01/155-trick-or-treaters.aspx), but this year we
had 162 trick-or-treaters show up at our door looking for candy.
 
 I think we had far fewer "too old for this" kids, and I didn't run into
any lippy ones this year. Here's the breakdown time-wise:

 The 6:00 - 7:00 hour was our most productive, with the block from 6:30
to 7:00 topping us out at 59 kids. I thought about trying to tally kids
by age group and time, but it's too hard to tell with the costumes on
and the kids come in far too fast for any accuracy beyond a basic
count.
 
 I wore [my *Joust*
costume](/archive/2006/10/31/halloween-2006---joust.aspx) and the kids
seemed to like it, but *the parents loved it*. Comments included "You're
my hero!" and "That's the greatest costume ever!" One dad stooped down
to address his kids and explain the merits of classic arcade games right
there on my front porch. I claim that as success.
 
 A couple of folks told me they had seen a costume like mine earlier in
the evening. Is someone out there reading my blog and ripping off my
ideas? Bastards. (That said, what the hell else would you do with an
inflatable ostrich costume. Kind of obvious what it lends itself to,
isn't it?)
 
 We, again, didn't run out of candy this year, so it looks like two big
Costco bags will work. We didn't know how far it would go, so from 6:00
- 7:00 we were giving out two mini-candy-bars each, but at 7:00 we
switched to one because we were running low. We had enough left over
that I think we could have stuck with two bars per kid and maybe had
just enough.
