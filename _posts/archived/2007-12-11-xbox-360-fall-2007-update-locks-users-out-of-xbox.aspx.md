After a long, heated discussion with an Xbox Live support technician
last night, it turns out that my latest issue - [where I'm unable to get
the latest dashboard update so I can't log into Xbox
Live](/archive/2007/12/10/xbox-live-drm-eating-my-lunch.aspx) - is
actually pretty common.  According to the technician, they've been
getting hammered with calls from people who are having the exact same
problem.  These problems are coupled with the fact that the update has
caused some unexpected new load on the Xbox Live servers (undoubtedly
the use of the new Friends of Friends feature coupled) and that seems to
be coupled with the unexplained issue that there are several folks like
me who are just plain "locked out."

They're going to send me a DVD with the last dashboard update on it (not
the Fall 2007 one, but the Spring 2007 one) and that's supposed to at
least unlock things long enough for me to recover my profile so I can
play... well, anything.  Can't do much without your profile.  As for
being "unlocked," the answer was just to "keep trying to take the update

- when you can take it, you know it's fixed."  No ETA on that, by the
way.

I'm surprised no gaming sites have reported this issue, but then, I'm
sure this crap happens on every dashboard update.

**UPDATE:** The problem was [corruption on my hard
drive](/archive/2008/01/28/status-on-xbox-live-drm-and-dashboard-problems.aspx).
They ended up sending me a new hard drive.
