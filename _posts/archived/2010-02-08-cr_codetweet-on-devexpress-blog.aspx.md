[My CR\_CodeTweet plugin](http://cr-codetweet.googlecode.com) for
tweeting code from Visual Studio is [getting a little publicity on the
DevExpress
Blog](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2010/02/08/tweet-your-code-from-visual-studio.aspx)
thanks to Mehul Harry, one of their evangelists. There's even [a video
of how it all works](http://tv.devexpress.com/CRtwitter.movie) - very
cool.

[![Watch how to share code on Twitter from inside Visual
Studio.](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/image_76EEB36E.png "Watch how to share code on Twitter from inside Visual Studio.")](http://tv.devexpress.com/CRtwitter.movie)

I even get [a chance to give my buddy Scott Hanselman a hard
time](/archive/2005/03/22/hanselingo.aspx) at the end of the video. :)

[The plugin is free and available for download now, so go get
it!](http://cr-codetweet.googlecode.com)
