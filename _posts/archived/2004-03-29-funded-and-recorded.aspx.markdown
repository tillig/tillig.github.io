Friday afternoon my home loan officially funded and recorded, which
means the house is officially mine. Part of the offer agreement was to
let the current owner live there rent-free until the fifth of April,
though, so I don't have keys yet.

 Turns out the current owner will be out on Saturday, April 3, so I'll
get keys then. We don't have the utilities scheduled to be turned on
until the fifth, though, so we can take a couple of loads of the fragile
stuff over and that's about it. Maybe just run around in the empty house
and enjoy the fact we're moving.

 The packing process kicked up a load of dust this weekend so my
allergies are going nuts. I think this is the worst part of the whole
process - the packing and actual moving. Next time I'm going to try to
budget to have our stuff packed and moved and everything. I'm taking the
opportunity while packing to get rid of stuff I don't need anymore, but
couldn't I do that while unpacking just as easily?

 We also started painting this cobalt blue wall in our apartment back to
white. We've got two coats of primer on there and we'll put a third on
tonight before painting it back to the original white color. The
primer's doing a great job of covering the color up; I'm not sure why
people complain so much about colored walls.
