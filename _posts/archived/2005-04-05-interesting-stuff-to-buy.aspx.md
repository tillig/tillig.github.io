This new [*Visual Studio
Hacks*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596008473/mhsvortex)
book looks kind of interesting. I might have to pick that up. I wonder
how relevant it is to VS 2005. [Eric J.
Smith](http://weblogs.asp.net/ericjsmith/) reviewed it and gave it 5
stars, which holds some weight (even though he did contribute to the
book...).
 
[*Elektra*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007P0Y7C/mhsvortex)
is out on DVD today. Might have to pick that up this weekend. It wasn't
terribly faithful to the comic, but it was reasonably entertaining, and
how can you pass up Jennifer Garner?
