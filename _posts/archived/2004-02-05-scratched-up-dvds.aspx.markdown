I went a couple of days ago to the video store and bought a couple of
previously viewed DVDs. I got them home and saw that a couple of them
had some scuff and scratch marks on them.

 The thing is, while they have a year long warranty, I may not get to
watch every single minute of all of the special features and everything
right away. How do I tell how readable the disc is without having to
watch every second of the movie? And then, what happens if later down
the line, the discs become too scratched to read anymore? Am I out of
luck?

 Not so - I picked up a copy of [DVD X
Rescue](http://www.dvdxcopy.com/DVDXrescue.asp) by 321 Studios. They
license technology from Arrowkey (or look *awfully similar* to the
Arrowkey software package [CD/DVD
Diagnostic](http://www.arrowkey.com/cddvd_diagnostic.html)). DVD X
Rescue has the ability not only to analyze a messed up disc and retrieve
data, but also to analyze messed up video DVDs and retrieve data from
them.

 Got a bad DVD that your player doesn't like? Pull the movie off and
burn it to a new disc so you can watch it again.

 The reason I got it, though, is it has a "readability test" such that
you can put discs in and see whether you're going to get errors when you
try to play them. No longer do you have to watch 20 hours of extra
features to see if it skips - run it through this media tester and away
you go.
