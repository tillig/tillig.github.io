The new TV rocks. Watched it last night and it's just awesome. Love it.

 On the other hand, Roomba has decided to start wandering erratically
and not quite functioning right. I notified the Roomba support folks and
they're going to send me a whole new Roomba.

 I have yet to be disappointed by Roomba customer service. They're
really cool there and just want to resolve your issue.

 Maybe this is a little of my bad karma coming back to haunt me? Get the
TV fixed and Roomba breaks? Eh. I can handle it.
