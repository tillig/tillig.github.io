 [Marty](http://www.mildperil.net/blog/) has come up with some
interesting rants on his site that are definitely overdue, Marty being
the person he is. Some I agree with, some I don't; some arguments are
convincing, some aren't; some blame is correctly placed, some isn't.
Regardless, I'm glad Marty's decided to "stir the pot," so to speak,
because it's his trademark inflammatory nature that I've looked forward
to seeing since he started his site. I may just come up with some
rebuttal arguments to his entries when I get time. Until then, [check
out his site](http://www.mildperil.net/blog/), then [discuss in the
forum](http://www.mildperil.net/forum/). We're hoping to get some good
debate action going on in there.

 I've finished the last lab of the class, I've filled out my course
evaluation, and now there's only a final review to do and that's it. I'm
going to go ahead and post so I can high-tail it out of here when it's
over.
