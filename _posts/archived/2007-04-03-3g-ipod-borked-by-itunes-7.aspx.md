I think Jenn's been hit by [the iTunes 7 problem that a lot of other
folks have
seen](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/itunes-7-breaking-ipods-211913.php).
She has a 3G iPod and we recently updated to iTunes 7.x (I don't
remember the exact version, but we had been putting off the upgrade for
a while and finally bit the bullet fairly recently).
 
 Anyway, I've had to replace the battery in that iPod once already, and
it was, oh, within the last year or so, so the battery is good. What
we're seeing is that she can play the iPod all day long - like six to
eight hours - without issue on battery power alone, but the second she
plugs it into iTunes to sync up, the screen flashes that the battery is
dead and the iPod refuses to sync.
 
 This happened after we saw [the dreaded "1418
error"](http://www.1418hell.com) and I had to do some fancy footwork to
restore the iPod. It's working now, but it won't sync.
 
 I'm thinking we might be screwed, which sort of sucks. That iPod has
given us years of good service and it's not broken, it just won't sync.
I can't say I'm terribly pleased, but since I can't definitively pin the
cause on the software, I can't really say there's no issue. Or can I?
 
 Is this going to force me into an upgrade?
