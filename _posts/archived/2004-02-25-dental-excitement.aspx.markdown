I went to the dentist yesterday morning to have my teeth cleaned. Not
the most exciting procedure in the world, but I gotta keep these pearly
yellows clean.
 
 So I got the cleaning done and made it all the way to the final exam
where the dentist comes in and pokes around in your mouth for a couple
of seconds when he declared that one of my fillings was "rough" on top
and needed to be smoothed out (I hadn't noticed, but maybe that's just
me) and another of my fillings was acting like a "wedge" and my tooth
was cracking so the filling would have to be replaced.
 
 Thus, I went in *again this morning* to have the royal treatment. I got
the gas, I got the numbing gel, I got the shots, and I got a new
filling. All the while I listened to a little *Blue Man Group* on the
iPod.
 
 What really killed me was the part when I left and found out how much I
owed. I have a 10% responsibility on the bill; insurance covers 90%. I
ended up paying *\$78*. That means a filling costs *\$780*. Isn't that
pretty exorbitant? I was only there for a frickin' hour! Maybe I should
be in the medical profession.
 
 Thank goodness they take Visa.
