I'm pleased to announce I've got the
[CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) 3.0.0.0 release
[up and running in the Visual Studio
Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/668a65b5-2468-4afa-b78d-8c369850e2b2)!

You can either [get it from the
gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/668a65b5-2468-4afa-b78d-8c369850e2b2),
or, from the Visual Studio Extension Manager, search for "documentor,"
"dxcore," "coderush," or other related terms and it'll come up.

It's a full VSIX installer, so it'll install right into Visual Studio
without you needing to download, unzip, or do anything additional.

(I think I'm the first DXCore plugin with a VSIX installer to appear in
the gallery, so... I have to say, I'm a little proud. **Huge props to
the DevExpress folks** who made this possible.)
