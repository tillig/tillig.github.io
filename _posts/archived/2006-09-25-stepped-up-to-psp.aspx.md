![PSP Entertainment
Pack]({{ site.url }}/images/20060925psp.jpg)After
[thinking about it for a
while](/archive/2006/09/21/maybe-time-for-psp.aspx) and talking about it
for, like, a year or more, I finally stepped up and bought myself [a PSP
(PlayStation
Portable)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HTUY4Q/mhsvortex).

 I realize I'm a little late to the show on this one, but it's pretty
bad-ass. The screen is nice and crisp, no dead/stuck pixels (that I've
found so far), and I've got a
[couple](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007VDF22/mhsvortex) of
[games](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000057URK/mhsvortex) for
it that are pretty neat.

 I actually ended up with it since I'm going to be taking a couple of
trips soon (Vegas this weekend, Aruba for the honeymoon) and want to
watch some movies and play games on the flight. I figured, for the
price, as a portable game and media platform, it can't be beat. Plus
[the package I
got](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HTUY4Q/mhsvortex) was
pretty good for all the
[extra](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00076SC4S/mhsvortex)
[stuff](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ALM4BW/mhsvortex)
[you get](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000057URK/mhsvortex).

 Now I just need to get a protective case and I'm set to go.
