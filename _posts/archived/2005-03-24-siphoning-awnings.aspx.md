I worked from home for a while today because my [Sunsetter
awning](http://www.sunsetter.com) was being delivered. That came in a
19-foot-long, one-foot-diameter tube. One tube. It barely fits in the
garage. That's going to be awkward to set up.

 While I was home, I decided to call a plumber to fix this toilet I've
got downstairs. You flush it, and it continues to trickle for several
minutes after it finishes filling. I stared at it for probably an hour
and was about ready to tear it apart when I decided just to call
someone. Ended up calling [Bob's Reedville
Plumbing](http://www.bobsreedvilleplumbing.com) - a same-day service
outfit.

 The guy showed up and about three seconds later says, "Oh, it's
siphoning." Siphoning? Yeah, there's this tube thing that has to end
somewhere above the water line in the back of the tank or it'll continue
running. Mine ended below the water line, so water was being siphoned
out of the back of the tank into the drain.

 I would never have figured that out.

 The fix? Move the tube up a quarter inch.

 Expensive lesson, though - cost me $121.50 (that's with 10% off) to
learn it. The plumber felt bad charging me because he didn't do much.
But it's fixed now. Plus, again, I'd never have figured that out.

 If you need a plumber in the Hillsboro, OR area - check out [Bob's
Reedville Plumbing](http://www.bobsreedvilleplumbing.com). Fast and
friendly service, there within a couple of hours of your call, and they
guarantee they'll fix any problem in the same day.
