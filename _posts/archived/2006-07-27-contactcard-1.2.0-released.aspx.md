The new version automatically rewrites links on the page that match URLs
for contacts you have defined. This makes it zero-effort to implement -
just link to various contacts, and their contact card will automatically
be associated with that link.

 [Go get
it!](/archive/2006/06/06/contactcard-dhtml-contact-information.aspx)
