Okay, so they were supposed to be here between 11:00a and noon to get
the TV, and I've been here since 11:30a waiting, but they've changed to
1:30p - 2:30p because their first appointment of the day (scheduled
before me, around 10:30a or so, I'd wager) "is really hard to find." Oh,
and they've reserved the right to amend that new window, too.
 
 This is their last ditch attempt to make me give up on my TV ever being
fixed, isn't it?
