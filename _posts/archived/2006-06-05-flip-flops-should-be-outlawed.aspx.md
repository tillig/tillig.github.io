I'm a reasonably easy-going person. Reasonably. And I'm all for folks
who want to wear comfortable clothing. I, myself, am not a fashion plate
by any means, usually opting for the jeans-and-a-screen-print-t-shirt
look.
 
 But there is something about flip-flops that I *cannot fucking stand*.
 
 The *slap-slap-slap* of your sheer footwear incompetence echoes through
my mind as you meander past. And you must meander, because it is
impossible - nay, *punishment* - for you, the flip-flop wearer (or
"flopper," as you might be called), to move with any purpose. Should
that happen, not only would the mindset of the laid-back shoe choice be
contradicted, but the sheer physical torture of the harder, more
frequent *slap-slap-slap* against the bottoms of your tender, tender
feet would become too much to bear.
 
 No, you must meander. Or you must shuffle, which is just as bad. The
inability of many floppers to pick up their feet is something that
scientific studies should be written on. Perfectly capable human being
one day, utter sloth the next. The transformation is inexplicable.
 
 It only makes it worse that people seem to think that flip-flops are a
positive fashion statement of late. You know you've seen this one -
gorgeous woman walking through the mall, a "10" on any scale, shirt that
costs more than you make in a week, pants that fit perfectly, hair done
up "just so..." And a pair of *God damn flip-flops* on her feet.
 
 It's a good thing I'm not single because flip-flops are grounds for
instant disqualification. Flip-flops and smoking. In that order. Thank
God Jenn doesn't smoke and won't wear flip-flops, I'd have to dump her
ass like a used [Yugo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo).
 
 In fact, there are only four acceptable times at which you may wear
flip-flops:
1.  You're in the shower at the gym
2.  You're walking on the beach
3.  You just escaped from jail and had to steal shoes from the closest
    convenience store
4.  You're about to get arrested on
    [*Cops*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0096563/)


 All other times - no go. If you're on the fence, save yourself. There
are countless other models of sandal that you can take part in that
won't sacrifice your position in the eyes of humanity. Do not succumb to
be a flopper.
