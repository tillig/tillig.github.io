I bought the [Blokus
game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00011F5DK/mhsvortex)
(which you can [play online](http://www.blokus.com), too) from Amazon
and it arrived yesterday.
 
 Short a piece, natch.
 
 So I called the customer service number they provided and a lady with a
thick Texan accent answered the phone and...
 
 **Lady**: How may I direct your call?
 **Me**: I'm missing a game piece. I'm not sure where I'd be directed
for that...
 **Lady**: Is this the Blokus game?
 **Me**: Well, yeah.
 **Lady**: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to redirect you
to a voicemail box where there won't be a message. When you hear the
beep, leave your name, address, and a description of the pieces that are
missing and we'll mail them to you.
 **Me**: Um... okay.
 **Lady**: Here you go.
 **\*beep\***
 
 There's a *missing piece hotline* for this game. Yow.
 
 We played anyway last night, faking the missing piece with a slip of
paper, and it was a lot of fun. I recommend it, but keep the
instructions around - that's where the missing piece hotline number is.
