In both Vista and Windows 7, when running at full 1920 x 1080
resolution, I found that I would occasionally see a one or two pixel
"line" along the right side of my TV when playing video. It looked like
some sort of artifact left from the menu I was just using to select the
video, but I couldn't tell. I started down the road of trying to figure
out if I needed to tweak some overscan setting or something when [I
posted to The Green Button
forums](http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/81192/403439.aspx#403439) to
see if anyone else saw this.

Turns out [there's a hotfix for this specific
issue](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/974324).

[KB 974324](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/974324): "Black
and white pixels unexpectedly appear on the right side of the screen
when you run Windows Media Center in full-screen mode in Windows 7 or in
Windows Vista."

Downloaded and installed the hotfix, problem solved. If you're seeing
this problem, grab the hotfix.
