The trip home was probably the most stressful part of the entire venture
into Bellevue. I left convienently at 4:45p from the class - just enough
time to struggle onto the freeway (all of those Microsofties leave
around then, combined with the construction that screwed me on the way
up in the first place) and crawl the 20 miles to Tacoma.
 
 Of course, I had to stop and pee on the way because it took me like an
hour and a half to get that far and I had been drinking loads of
Mountain Dew.
 
 The way home, other than that, was pretty uneventful. I discovered only
a few things of interest on the way.
 
 First, my car goes 95mph just as easily as it goes 50mph.
 
 Second, there is definitely a Hooters in Tacoma, and I definitely need
to go.
 
 Third, if you see a giant neon sign advertising a "BJ Tournament," it's
not what you think it is. It's probably attached to a casino and it
probably involves cards.
 
 Finally, along the Washington-Oregon border there is a magic curtain
that everyone passes through and instantly forgets how to drive. I mean,
it's like a wall. People can be going 70mph on the road with no issues
not five minutes before, but you hit the border and people just *forget*
how to drive. They stop signalling, they slow down for no apparent
reason, they go slow in the fast lane and fast in the slow lane... it's
ridiculous.
 
 And now I'm home. Not much more I can say about that. It was nice to
sleep in my own bed last night, but isn't it always nicer to sleep in
your own bed?
