Well, maybe not secrets, but lesser known troubleshooting steps and help
for Xbox 360.  I'm learning way too much about this
[lately](/archive/2007/12/10/xbox-live-drm-eating-my-lunch.aspx).

- **Clearing your update cache**:  This clears out the cache of
    dashboard, system, and other updates in case something gets glitched
    and you can't update.  Go to the System blade, then select
    "Memory."  From that screen, select your hard drive, then hit "Y" to
    get to "Device Options."  From there, use the controller to enter:
    X, X, LB, RB, X, X.  You'll get a message asking if you want to
    perform maintenance on the device - select Yes.  This didn't do
    anything for my latest problem, but [it's worked for some
    people](http://gaming.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=5895).
- **Manually update the dashboard**:  Deep in the bowels of the Xbox
    Support site they have instructions on how to download and [burn
    your own dashboard update
    CD](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/console/systemupdates.htm).
    I tried this but was never able to get it to work; that said, I
    already had the update the disc contained, so maybe it didn't try to
    re-apply.  Xbox Support will recommend this to you if you're having
    trouble taking an update over the network.
