My damn driver's side headlight is out. [This happened in
September](/archive/2004/10/26/110-lunch.aspx), which I fixed, [then
again in January](/archive/2005/01/14/surreal-maintenance.aspx). So this
is the third time in six months I've had this shit.
 
 I called the Acura service department and I'm going in on Thursday to
have them look at it. I told the guy I was using the Sylvania Silverstar
headlights and he says he has them, too, but he had to *rewire his truck
to handle them*.
 
 I most certainly did not rewire my car, and he thinks it's probably too
much. I'm going to get the factory headlights (which previously lasted
me like two years), have them do a cursory check, and call it a day.
