There was a meeting yesterday afternoon between me and some contractors
that are coming to work with us on some stuff at work. This was actually
the second meeting, the first being last week.

 The first meeting was bullshit. It was twenty minutes worth of
information packed into an hour. Most of it was mutual masturbation crap
- "It's a great opportunity to work with your company because " and
"True, but it will also be good experience for us to work with you
because " and so on. I still don't understand all that; it's not fucking
international *diplomacy* or anything. But whatever.

 The second meeting, yesterday, was much better. We got to start
explaining what we had and where we wanted to go with things.

 Where am I going with this meeting conversation? The thing is, during
that meeting I finally got to explain to people some of the stuff I do
all day long and have them appreciate what exactly it was that I did and
how that (in my opinion) so elegantly solved the problem it was directed
at. It was nice to be able to do that for once, because I don't normally
get a chance to. The stuff I do is invisible; if I do my job right,
you'll never know I was there - problems just disappear. Only other
problem-solvers can truly appreciate the elegance of a good solution.

 After that, I was yearning for some new tunes, so I headed over to the
local [Wherehouse](http://www.wherehousemusic.com).

 Now, I've heard that several Wherehouse stores are going out of
business because the people just aren't coming in to buy records. Let me
say this now - the people aren't coming in to buy records because The
Wherehouse charges *too damn much*. I appreciate that they maintain a
brick-and-mortar shop so they can't very well lower prices enough to
beat online stores, but in many cases I can find albums for which The
Wherehouse will charge 50% more than other brick-and-mortar shops. I
mean, starting price over there was like \$17 for a new CD. That's
crazy! I can get that same disc for \$12 online, or maybe \$14 at some
other store. Forget it.

 That said, they do have a decent used section, so that's where I
headed.

 I went in looking for one or more of the following: [Michael Jackson -
*Bad*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QGAX/mhsvortex);
[Michael Jackson - *Off The
Wall*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QGAT/mhsvortex);
[Soup Dragons -
*Lovegod*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FWG/mhsvortex);
[Red Hot Chili Peppers - *Blood Sugar Sex
Magik*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LQR/mhsvortex).

 I did not find any of them.

 I ended up coming out of the store with [Simply Red - *Greatest
Hits*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002HO3/mhsvortex) and
[Michael Penn -
*March*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RDCF/mhsvortex).

 Why those?

 Well, Simply Red... I'm not sure. That music sort of evokes a
particular mindset for me. For example, you know when you go over to
someone's house for a party and everyone's walking around with wine
glasses and the entire house is decorated like a [Pottery
Barn](http://www.potterybarn.com/) catalog? You ever listen to the music
playing on the ultra-high-fidelity low-profile stereo? It's Simply Red.
I just felt like picking that up for the bargain price of \$8.99.

 Most people don't know who Michael Penn is. Besides the fact that he's
[Sean Penn's](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Penn,+Sean) younger brother, he
put out a song around 1989 called "No Myth" with a chorus that goes:

> What if I were Romeo in black jeans
>  What if I was [Heathcliff](http://www.filmsite.org/wuth.html), it's
> no myth
>  Maybe she's just looking for
>  Someone to dance with

The thing is, I think it was a pretty popular song, but no one ever
knows who sang it. Anyway, I found the album that it's on (which is hard
to find as it is unless you order it online) and got it for *\$1.48*.
Can't beat that. I'm still making my way through the other songs on
there, but I figured, even if they all suck, that's \$1.48 for a single
to a song that rocks. I can handle that.

 (By the way, I had to [look up who Heathcliff
is](http://www.filmsite.org/wuth.html). Apparently a character from
Emily Bronte's [*Wuthering
Heights*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553212583/mhsvortex).
Never had to read that, don't think I'm going to now.)

 So I got out of The Wherehouse with two albums for a grand total of
\$10.47. Can't beat that, can ya?
