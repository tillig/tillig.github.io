![The Wicker
Man](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pPpFyR_ehvp6E66EUhnCpL0DWl4_J0SxXyKZ_D564aaKhZI1l_Niaz4PtvxPZbPHun17FwSiKyuG2advMtEAB1GtOOZBHWX9z2fP-WVRRb1Q/20060905wickerman.jpg?psid=1)Jenn
and I went to see [*The Wicker
Man*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0450345/) yesterday. While it doesn't
seem to be soaring in [the ratings on
IMDB](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0450345/ratings), I didn't think it was
all that bad.

 The premise of the movie is that [Nicolas
Cage](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/) is a cop who witnesses a
traumatic accident. While he's taking some time off to get his head
straight, he gets a letter from an old girlfriend (played by [Kate
Beahan](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0063571/)) asking him to come to this
isolated commune she lives on called Summersisle because she needs help
finding her daughter. When he gets there, he finds that there are all
nature of weird things going on and its up to him to figure out what the
real story is.

 I thought it was OK. I wasn't blown away or anything, and I guessed the
twist at the end with about half an hour to spare. I also had an issue
with Beahan's mouth the whole time - her lips are sort of weird (too
large? misshapen?) and I had a difficult time concentrating on what she
was saying when her mouth was moving. There was also this odd disconnect
between the accident that Cage witnesses at the beginning of the movie
and his arrival on the island. What relevance did that have? Was it just
a mechanism to get him into convalescence so he would be receptive to
getting the letter? A plot convenience? I'm still figuring that out.

 That said, I've seen some pretty sucky movies lately, so I can't really
bag on this one too bad. I think it'd be a decent rental, but you might
not want to pay full price for it at the theater.

 Interesting item I didn't know - [it's a remake of a 1973
movie](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0070917/). Kind of makes me want to
see the original to see if it's any better. It's got [almost double the
ratings](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0070917/ratings) as the remake, so
maybe it's doubly good.
