Granted, I'm slow to find this stuff, but EGM has a couple of hilarious
articles where they have kids from today play classic games like Space
Invaders and Tetris. The reaction of the kids is too funny and makes you
feel kind of old.
 
 [Article 1 - November 2003: Pong, Donkey Kong, Handheld Football,
Tetris, Super Mario Brothers, ET, Space
Invaders](http://www.lyberty.com/blog/articles/childs_play.htm)
 
 [Article 2 - 2005: Punch Out, Adventure, Legend of Zelda, Star Wars,
Defender, 720Â°, Grand Theft Auto, Gunstar Heroes, Galaga, Street Fighter
II](http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3137498)
