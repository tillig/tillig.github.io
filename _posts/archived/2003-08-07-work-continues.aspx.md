I've started studying for the next test I have to take, MS 070-320,
which is entitled *Developing XML Web Services and Server Components
with Microsoft Visual C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework*. what it
should really be called is *Everything You Don't Know*.

 I mean, I've taken *loads* of classes, including the classes that they
recommend to prepare you for the test. I felt that I did pretty well at
them. I feel like I remember the stuff, and it all seemed pretty
reasonable. But I'm looking at the practice test, and I'm wondering if
the people who came up with these questions realize that *I'm human*.
It's nuts. Like if you took a Spanish class and on the final they start
asking you what the Latin roots of certain words are. Pretty
ridiculous.

 So I'm taking home my class materials from those classes and will
re-read them (because either I've forgotten stuff or they really didn't
talk much about this stuff), and then will continue working on the
practice tests. Crazy.

 I've decided, though, that if/when I pass this thing, I'm going to
reward myself with some better earbud headphones because the ones that
I'm using right now (the ones that sit sort of precariously and
sometimes painfully toward the outside of your ear canal) are, well, not
so comfortable. I want to get some of [these Sony ones that actually go
*in* your
ear](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000092YQW/mhsvortex). From
what I've seen, they're pretty awesome.

 I'm still working on SharePoint Portal Server version 2 stuff here at
work, which is getting older than I can possibly explain. It's review
time at work, and one of the things on the review is to determine what
your goals for the coming year are. I have one goal - to *not* work on
SharePoint Portal Server. I've been working on the same stupid project
for like eight months with no help and no light at the end of the
tunnel. Every time I think I'm getting near the end, there are more
"enhancements" or there's something else that gets "included" in the
project. I mean, what I liked about my job before was the *variety* of
different stuff I got to work on. There ain't no variety anymore,
folks.

 Speaking of which, I should probably get back on that. There's a lot to
do and I found out today that I don't have as much time to finish as I
thought I did. Which figures.

 By the way, I got [this shitty little digital
camera](http://www.che-ez.com/english/splash/index.html) that I can take
pictures with to post up here. It's not great quality, but something is
better than nothing. Now I'm almost *hoping* that my stupid neighbors
park in the fire lane [again] so I can show you how ridiculous it is.
