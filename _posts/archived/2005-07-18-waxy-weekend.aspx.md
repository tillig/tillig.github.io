This weekend [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and I took the
entirety of Saturday and a box full of
[Zaino](http://www.zainostore.com) products and did the full
wash-and-wax routine on our respective automobiles.

 We started at 9:30a. By 11:00a we had done an initial wash, run the
[claybar](http://www.zainostore.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=Z-18&Category_Code=Zaino)
over the cars, and finished a secondary wash.

 We had to take a break from 11:00a to around 5:00p because it was too
hot outside. The day was supposed to be about 72 and overcast; it turned
out to be closer to 80 and sunny. Not so great for waxing (we would have
been in full sun).

 During that break, we went out and grabbed something to eat at the
mall, then came back home and played some [*Donkey Konga
2*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007XS1HY/mhsvortex). Lots
of fun, but we needed to get things going again, and when 5:00p rolled
around, it looked like we'd have enough shade to finish the job.

 We got three coats of wax on (two

and one
[Z-2](http://www.zainostore.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=Z-2&Category_Code=Zaino))
and had cleaned the interiors of both cars by the time we called it a
night at around 10:00p. The light was gone, and we had accomplished what
we wanted to accomplish.

 Sunday I had no problems totally sleeping in, took a nap in the
afternoon, and went right to sleep Sunday night. The wax job totally
wore me out. Thank goodness it's just maintenance from here on out
(until a few years down the road when we decide to start over with the
claybar again - [last time I did
this](/archive/2003/07/14/my-high-school-reunion.aspx) was a couple of
years ago).
