I will be out next week for the [SharePoint Products and Technologies
Developers'
Conference](http://www.dynamicevents.com/SharePointPTDevCon.htm) in
Redmond, WA. I won't be able to post from there, nor will I be getting
email. Keep that in mind if you email me something "urgent" - I know
last time I was out some folks either didn't check the blog for the
notice or disregarded it entirely and sent me some time-sensitive stuff.
Sorry if I didn't get back to you in time; I won't get back to you next
week, either.
