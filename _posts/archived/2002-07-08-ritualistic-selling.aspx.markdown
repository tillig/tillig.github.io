This morning I went in to my local [Target](http://www.target.com) store
to see if they had any little cast-iron bistro sets that I could put on
my apartment deck (they didn't). While there, I witnessed something I'm
not sure I was supposed to see.

 Upon trying to check out, I approached the cash register area... and no
one was there. Looking closer, I saw that every Target employee on duty
was in the customer service area.

 There were probably 30 of them, standing in a large circle, all of them
doing Tai-Chi-like exercises, all in *perfect unison*. When I
approached, the entire group stopped and their apparent leader turned to
look me right in the eye, and in a monotone voice declared, "It looks
like we have *a guest*."

 One of the employees broke off long enough to scan my item, take my
money, and send me on my way. As I walked out the door, I could see her
returning to (what I've decided to call) "The Pod."

 Let me tell you, it was weird. It wouldn't have been any *more* weird
had they been standing around a pentagram in goatskin chaps. It makes me
wonder if these morning rituals have anything to do with the success of
the store. Hmmm. I wonder if other stores take part in such things.
Anyone out there know?
