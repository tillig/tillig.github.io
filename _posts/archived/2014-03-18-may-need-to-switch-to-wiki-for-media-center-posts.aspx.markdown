Looking at the list of media center posts I’ve got and the
updates/changes over time [just to the main
article](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx),
I’m thinking I may need to switch to storing this in a wiki. The world
of media center stuff changes too frequently to keep the articles all
updated. It’s just getting confusing.
