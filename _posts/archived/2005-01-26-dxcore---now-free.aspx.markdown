DXCore, the core engine behind [CodeRush for Visual Studio
.NET](http://www.devexpress.com/products/net/coderush/), has been
released to the public as a [free
download](http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/DXCore/).
 
 This is a great thing for anyone interested in extending the Visual
Studio environment. DXCore is everything that the Visual Studio
extensibility team should have implemented to begin with. It's easy to
make Visual Studio add-ins, it's easy to create graphic assistance
within the Visual Studio editor, it's easy to do great things to enhance
your productivity.
 
 Plus, that's what my [CR\_Documentor
add-in](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
is based on, and you all want that, right?
 
 [Go get your free copy of
DXCore!](http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/DXCore/)
 
 (And once you fall in love with that, get
[CodeRush](http://www.devexpress.com/products/net/coderush/) and
[Refactor!](http://www.devexpress.com/products/net/refactor/) - you'll
never look back.)
