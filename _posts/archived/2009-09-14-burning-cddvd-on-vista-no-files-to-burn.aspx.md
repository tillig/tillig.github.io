I was archiving some data onto DVDs in Windows Vista, using the regular
Vista burn-to-disc functionality. On one disc, for a reason I won't go
into, I had one folder at the root level and about 60 files in that
folder. When I tried to burn the disc, though, I got a message, "No
files to burn."

That didn't make any sense. Running a quick Google search yields a lot
of people with the same problem. Turns out the fix is to burn at least
two files at the root level. Adding a "readme.txt" to the root of the
disc alongside the folder magically made things work.

What's up with that crazy must-have-two-files requirement? Who thought
that was a good idea?
