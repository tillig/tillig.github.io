Sunday was my first trip to an [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com) store ever.

I never really understood what the big deal with Ikea was.  Everyone I
talked to who'd been there would start salivating when I talked about
Ikea, barely able to contain their feelings about how awesome it is.  My
uncle (and many, many others) swears by the meatballs.  I've got friends
who would only ever shop at Ikea (and no other stores, ever) if they had
that option.  I just never got it.

Sunday, Jenn and I packed up and, with our friends Angela and Keaka,
headed to the Portland Ikea store.  I went with a skeptical mindset,
fully expecting to be underwhelmed.

Ikea *freaking rocks*.

Ikea is sort of like... well, if [General Electric](http://www.ge.com)
or [Mitsubishi](http://www.mitsubishi.com) decided to open a store that
just sold everything they made, that's what Ikea is.  They sell
everything.  Batteries.  Furniture.  Art.  Food.  Toys.  Seriously, it's
just overwhelming.  Angela told us she usually allocates about three
hours to an Ikea trip and I can see why - you can't actually make it
through the place in much under two.  We took two and a half hours.

I didn't expect to buy anything.  I've always seen the catalog and not
been really much interested in anything.  I ended up purchasing [a
chair](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90106158), [an
ottoman](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106141), [a
rug](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/62757663), and [some
artwork](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50126196) for our
front room.  All put together, it's got a really nice lounge sort of
feel to it, and it's nice to get some furniture in that room.  We've
been in the house for a few years now and have been looking for the
right stuff.  I think a key factor here was price - we got all that for
less than $750.  Not bad.

Of course, less than 24 hours went by before Jenn's cat peed on the
ottoman and the rug.  Maybe the low cost paid off.  (As far as I can
tell, the stains came out, but still.  *Come on.*)

We also had the obligatory meatball lunch in the cafe there and I liked
it.  I'm not all crazy over the meatballs, but they're pretty decent.  I
also discovered that I like lingonberry and several of the desserts
there.

So I'm an Ikea convert.  I finally get it.  I don't know that I'll
have a Pavlovian response or anything, but if someone says they want to
venture out to Ikea, I'll go.  As long as we have at least three hours
to kill.
