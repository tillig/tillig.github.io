This past three-day weekend was a blast. Jenn, Stuart, Tiffany, and I
all went up to Seattle on the train.

 Three days and two nights of chaos and mayhem. Among other things, we
saw [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/), [Experience
Music Project](http://www.emplive.org/), and the [Science Fiction Museum
and Hall of Fame](http://www.sfhomeworld.org/).
 
 EMP and the Sci-Fi Museum were my favorite stops. The two put together
took us pretty much an entire day. EMP sucked us in with the tons of
cool exhibits and hands-on demonstrations of musical concepts, and the
Sci-Fi Museum was a blast with all sorts of science fiction
paraphernalia. From movie props to original novels scripts, they had it
all. I even got a picture of myself next to Gort. (For reference, I'm
6'2" tall; Gort dwarfs me.)

 Honestly, normally I do the whole play-by-play of all the things we
did, but it was so much I don't even know where to begin. I'll just say
it was a lot of fun and a great weekend to decompress.
 
 Only downside: too much walking. I think the next vacation's gotta be
lying on the beach drinking umbrella drinks. Give these tootsies a
rest.
