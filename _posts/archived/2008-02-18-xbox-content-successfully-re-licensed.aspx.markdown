This weekend [finally] brought an end to [my latest struggles with Xbox
Live digital rights
management](/archive/2008/01/28/status-on-xbox-live-drm-and-dashboard-problems.aspx).
I didn't get a call from Xbox Support, which I was told I would get, but
I did notice that [several folks on the Xbox Live
forums](http://forums.xbox.com/18348208/ShowPost.aspx), also in my
situation, suddenly had their issues resolved without any notification,
so I figured I'd give it a shot, too.

When Xbox Support has fixed you up, you'll be able to go into the Xbox
Marketplace section of the dashboard, go to "Account Management," view
your Download History, and select "Download Again" for each of the items
you purchased. Doing that will automatically re-license the downloadable
content to the console so the other gamers in your household can play it
without you having to be logged in and you should be able to play it
without having to sign into Xbox Live. You don't need to delete the
content first - just select "Download Again" and the license for the
content will transfer.

Took about 15 minutes to go through my history and download everything a
second time, but after that, I was totally in business again. And, hey,
it only took, what - four months?
