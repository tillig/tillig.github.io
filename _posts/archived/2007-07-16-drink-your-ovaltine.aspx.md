At a recent conference I went to, I entered a drawing to win a prize
from one of the sponsors.  Other prizes being given out by other vendors
(and the conference host) were things like UMPCs, Xbox 360 consoles,
Xbox 360 games, and so forth.  Pretty cool stuff.

A month later I got this email from the sponsor that told me I had won
something and said, quote (emphasis theirs), "If you'd like to claim
your *fabulous* prize, please respond to this email with your mailing
address."

I was stoked.  Stoked!  I don't really ever win anything, so to win
something on this level - especially if they have to confirm my mailing
address after the form of entry was to drop my business card, *complete
with my mailing address*, into a basket for the drawing - was pretty
exciting.

I psyched myself up, wondering what it could be.  A UMPC would be cool,
but - no, don't get your hopes up that high.  Maybe an Xbox 360 game.  I
sure hope I don't have it already.  I suppose I could trade it in if I
do.  Maybe a gift card somewhere neat.  Even if it's something like
Amazon, hey, bonus.  *What could it be?*

The prize arrived today.  I saw it in my mailbox at work and walked over
to it, wondering.  It was in a manila envelope, so it wasn't anything as
big or bulky as a UMPC... but it could still be an Xbox game or a gift
card.  I walked over and picked it up, slightly unnerved by the...
soft... feel to the envelope.  But it could be packaging!  It could just
be the packaging!

I took the envelope back to my desk and tore into it, no longer able to
contain the anticipation, firmly ready to blog about *how freaking
awesome I am with this bitchin' prize*.  I pulled it out and...

*What the hell kind of happy horseshit is all this?*

![What is that? Golf club? Thumbs up? Speech
bubble?]({{ site.url }}/images/20070716whatisit.jpg)My
"fabulous prize" is a t-shirt of dubious manufacture.  No brand I've
ever heard of.  Far too thin to wear without - you guessed it - *another
t-shirt underneath*.  (Hey, not even *my wife* wants to see my man-boobs
showing through, and I certainly don't blame her.  I wouldn't want to
see that, either.)  Oh, and it's got this ad on the front for careers at
the company that, frankly, I don't get.  There's this weird shape that
is a cross between an upside-down speech bubble and the head of a golf
club that I think is supposed to be a hand giving a "thumb's up" sign,
but I can't be sure.  This weird image thing is intermingled with the
phrase "[Vendor Name] Makes Work FUN."  Ummmm, okay.

I feel a little like Ralphie in *[A Christmas
Story](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AYJUW?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000AYJUW)*
when he decoded Little Orphan Annie's secret message: "Drink Your
Ovaltine."  Ovaltine?!

Message to vendors at all future conferences I go to:  Rather than give
out crappy prizes, just... don't.  Don't give this junk away.  You're
ruining the environment by consuming resources, and I don't need any
more rags to wax my car with.  Instead, give away one good prize that
you won't award to me because I'm a loser and save me the effort of
another blog entry.
