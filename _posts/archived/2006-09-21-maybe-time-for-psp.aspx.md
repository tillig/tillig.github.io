I've been considering getting a PSP for a while now but just haven't
been pushed over the edge. My gadget interest has been generally low for
a while with no cool tech really calling out to me lately, so the PSP
has surfaced again as something I might be interested in.

 I was at the store this morning picking up a copy of the Rush album
[*The Spirit of Radio: Greatest Hits 1974 -
1987*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000794FS/mhsvortex)
([Neil Peart](http://www.neilpeart.net/) being arguably the best drummer
*ever*) and the guy at the store mentioned they were coming out with a
new PSP value pack of some sort that includes more stuff.

 A little research brings us to the [PSP Entertainment
Pack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HTUY4Q/mhsvortex),
which is like the existing "Value Pack" but with a [1GB memory
stick](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00076SC4S/mhsvortex), a
[movie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ALM4BW/mhsvortex),
and a
[game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000057URK/mhsvortex). A
little better deal for the money, though, granted, the system's not
brand-spanking-new to the market, either.

 It's something to think about. I hate to be on the tail end of
technology, but it's becoming a better deal so it might be worth a
shot.
