[Our new cat, Jack](/archive/2007/02/04/introducing-jack.aspx), is less
"cat" and more "spider monkey with claws." The longer we have him, the
wilder he gets. He has no issue flying out of nowhere to attach to your
back, leg, head, chest, or anything else he can sink his little needle
claws into.
 
 I'm also wondering if maybe we should have named him Osama, because
he's a damn terrorist. You never really know when he's going to strike.
You find yourself very tense even just sitting and watching TV because
at any time you might get fairly significantly injured. I was trying to
play some Xbox 360 just this morning and just as I was getting into the
game - *attack!* I have a fairly decent cut on my hand where he got me
good.
 
 I'm hoping he'll chill out, if just a little. I don't think my nerves
can take it much longer. He's gonna break me.
