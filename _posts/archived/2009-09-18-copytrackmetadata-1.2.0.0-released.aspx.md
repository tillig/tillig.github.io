[A while ago I wrote a little
app](/archive/2007/10/29/copytrackmetadata-copy-itunes-track-info.aspx)
that would let you copy iTunes metadata from one track to another. Due
to a breaking change in iTunes 9 where it doesn't handle selected tracks
in the UI the same way, I updated it. Still free, and source available
(and updated to .NET 3.5/VS 2008). [If you want it, grab
it.](/archive/2007/10/29/copytrackmetadata-copy-itunes-track-info.aspx)
