Coach Hines is a character on [MadTV](http://www.madtv.com/) that
teaches at a high school for boys. He's one of my favorite characters on
the show. Anyway, I was working on some fairly convoluted process stuff
the other day and it reminded me of the choreography from his version of
*Oliver Twist:*
