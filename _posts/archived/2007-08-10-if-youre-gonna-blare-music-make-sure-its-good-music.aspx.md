Coming out of the grocery store yesterday, I swore I heard an ice cream
truck.

It started quiet, sort of peaceful, like that background music you hear
sitting outside a decent coffee shop.  Second by second, it got louder.
And louder.

Looking around, I saw this car come *tearing* into the parking lot.
Tires squealing, careening around other cars, totally unsafe style, and
coming this way.

At this point, the music was so loud it was like I was listening to my
own headphones.  It had changed, though, from ice cream truck music a la
*[The
Entertainer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entertainer_%28rag%29)* to
something more lilting, bringing visions of castles and ponies and
princesses to mind.  Like [Zamfir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamfir),
but with more birds chirping and crap.

The car screeched into a parking spot and the driver stepped out, the
music immediately silenced as the car turned off.  The driver, acting
far more important than I'm sure he'll ever be, strutted into the store.

I'm not a big fan of those cars that crank their music up to share with
the neighborhood, but I mind it a little less if it's at least halfway
decent music.  I'd even take some ridiculous hardcore gangster rap over
this fluffy-pink-clouds garbage.  If you're gonna blare music, at least
make sure you're blaring *good* music.
