I totally lost sleep over this stupid demo thing I'm supposed to be
doing for work so I came in this morning and was like, "Look - I'm good,
but I'm not a magician. You guys want help? Fine. You want me to do like
700 pages of work in five weeks of half-time work? I don't think so. Not
really what I signed up for."
 
 Besides which, I don't get paid *nearly* enough to be putting in 80
hour weeks for this shit.
 
 So I'm stressed, and probably vastly undercaffeinated, and I think
maybe I need a job that doesn't involve computers. Maybe something like
costume design or sculpting.
 
 I went to [Enchanted Forest](http://www.enchantedforest.com/) this
weekend with Jenn's gaggle of girls. I took pictures, and when I get a
chance I'll tell you all about the trip and post the photos in the
gallery.
 
 I also went to see [*The
Rundown*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327850/) this weekend and *loved
it*. Again, if/when I get a chance, I'll post a review and let you know
how you need to just go see it *right now*.
 
 Oh, and I went to the fabric store to get some fusible interfacing for
my costume and came to the conclusion that, if I'm ever single again,
the fabric store is a great place to find hot single chicks.
