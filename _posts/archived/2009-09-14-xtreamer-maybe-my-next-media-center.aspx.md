I was reading some reviews of [the Xtreamer media streaming
device](http://www.thextreamer.com/) over on [the MS Windows Home Server
blog](http://mswhs.com/2009/09/13/xtreamer-media-player-and-streamer/)
and [on We Got
Served](http://www.wegotserved.com/2009/09/13/hands-on-xtreamer-media-player-and-streamer/)
and it appears this may be an affordable alternative to getting a full
Windows Media Center front end in every room. I need something that'll
play AAC music as well as DVD rips in VIDEO_TS format. (More important
are the VIDEO_TS rips.)

Turns out this little device [does, in fact, handle
VIDEO_TS](http://shop.xtreamer.net/Support/questions/93/How+do+I+backup+and+play+my+DVDs%3F),
just like Windows Media Center. [I confirmed
that](http://mswhs.com/2009/09/13/xtreamer-media-player-and-streamer/#comment-17818)
with one of the reviewers, too. I don't have access to our DVD library
in our bedroom right now; this might be just the thing, rather than
getting yet another computer.
