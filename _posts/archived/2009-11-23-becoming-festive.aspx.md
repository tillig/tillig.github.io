The holiday season has begun at home, preceded quite a bit by its start
in the stores. (Stores very nearly skipped Halloween this year and went
straight to Christmas, didn't they?)

First, we got a wreath for our door from a local door-to-door salesgirl.
This is important in two respects: First, I've never had a wreath
before, and while it sounds sort of clich√©, it's nice and sort of makes
me feel like "a real homeowner" (even though we've been at the same
place for years now). Second, if your kid gets off their ass and
actually does the door-to-door sales for their organization, I'll most
likely buy something; if you take the sign-up sheet to work and stick it
on the break area table and expect me to register... well, good luck
with that. Hard work gets rewarded.

Second, we went to the [Trans-Siberian
Orchestra](http://www.trans-siberian.com/) concert on Sunday. Not the
first time we've seen them, but a brilliant show. Everything with TSO is
always larger-than-life. Every number is *huge* and that just makes it
*full of awesome*. We were in the tenth row, center section on the aisle

- perfect seats. I snuck a few pictures toward the end with my crappy
Blackberry camera. Epic stuff. I'd totally go again.

This week is Thanksgiving and I totally can't stand turkey, nor am I
really big on attempting to coordinate a bajillion disparate schedules
to make sure everyone gets their "face time" in, which makes it my least
favorite holiday all year. (I think it'd be more important to get
together with people if we all didn't live within 45 minutes of each
other and see each other all the time.)

But I'm not going to let that drag me down. I've got this free-standing
two-foot-tall green M&M in a Santa hat to stick by our front door and
I've been waiting to put her out. Onward to the holidays!
