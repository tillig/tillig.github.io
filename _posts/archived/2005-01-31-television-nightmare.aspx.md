[I love my TV.](/archive/2002/10/07/a-forty-inch-weekend.aspx) Love it.
I bought it two years ago and haven't looked back.

 Until, of course, this weekend, when, as I was sitting there having a
great time watching movies, I noticed that the bottom corners of the
picture look distorted, like there's some magnetic interference or
something going on there. Very slight, but once I noticed it, it stuck
out like a sore thumb and I couldn't *not* look at it.

 I went looking for my receipt, which should accompany my warranty
information. I found the user manual and the factory warranty, but no
receipt. I mean, I found every receipt to almost everything I own, but
no TV receipt. I'm sure I put it in some secure place I wouldn't forget.
So secure, it's safe even from me.

 This put me into panic mode. See, the TV is *just* out of factory
warranty. For the life of me, I couldn't remember if I had bought the
extended warranty or not, and not having the receipt, I couldn't say.

 I called the place I bought the TV this morning and, sure enough, I was
smart enough to go for the extended warranty. (I think I worked it in
for free because the TV was such a high-ticket item.) Awesome. A huge
load off my chest, because I was thinking I was going to end up with a
$3000, 300-pound lump in the middle of my living room.

 Today has seen a flurry of phone calls. To the store I bought the TV
at, to the repair shop, to the electronics warranty firm... and I think
it's worked out now so a guy will call me on Wednesday to schedule the
time to come in and check it out.

 Here's hoping for goodness. I barely slept last night between that and
work stressing me out. Sometimes I'm thinking that life is just downs
with a small series of ups. I really hope I'm just being pessimistic.
