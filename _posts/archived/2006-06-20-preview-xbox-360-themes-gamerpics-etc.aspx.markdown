I dig the concept of themes and gamer pictures for Xbox 360. They have a
lot of cool ones on the Xbox Live Marketplace, too. The problem is, when
you're scrolling around through the Xbox 360 interface, you don't
actually get a good preview of what's in the theme pack or what the
pictures in the gamerpic pack look like.
 
 The [Xbox Live Marketplace
site](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/default.htm) actually
*does* have previews, though, both for
[themes](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/themes.htm) and
[gamerpics](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/marketplace/gamerpics.htm).
You can actually see what you're buying before you buy it. And I think
that's important, especially if there aren't any refunds. When are they
going to work that into the 360 interface?
