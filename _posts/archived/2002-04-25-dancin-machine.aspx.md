[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 18]
 
 I got my [dance
pad](http://www.buynshop.com/productinfophp3/VG-DDR-ULTX) in the mail on
Tuesday and tried ol'
[DDR](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A774/mhsvortex) out
using that instead of the standard controller.
 
 *Man*, have I got the *mad dancin' skillz!*
 
 Actually, to be totally honest, I barely made it through the tutorial.
I'm able to do a couple of the songs, but I really need to practice in
order to get, well, *coordinated*. While "dancing" (and I put "dancing"
in quotes because that's pretty much what I'm doing), I noticed a couple
of things:
 
-   You pay extra money for a [hard dance
    pad](http://www.buynshop.com/productinfophp3/VG-DDR-HD) for a
    reason. The soft ones, while affordable, do slide around a bit. I
    may have to make a more solid base for mine and somehow anchor it
    down.
-   I am *so* out of shape, it's utterly pathetic. I break a sweat doing
    a simple two-step. Just pathetic.


 
 It's a lot of fun, though. I can see how I could get addicted to it
pretty quickly. I should probably finish up [Grand Theft Auto
3](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/) and
[Rez](http://rez.u-ga.com/) before going too far with DDR.
 
 In other news...
 
 The
*[Alias](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/home/indexsd6.html)*
site on [ABC.com](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/) has some cool new
[wallpapers you can
download](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/downloads/sd6downloads.html)
for your computer. I'm stoked they finally have one with [Jennifer
Garner in the blue rubber
dress](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/downloads/desktop/bluedress-1600x1200.jpg)
she wore in the episode she went to Russia. I think that's my favorite
outfit she's worn on that show, though I can't really complain about
anything else she's worn. She's a hottie, regardless. This one just
makes me feel like rubber dresses should be a more commonly worn item of
apparel.
 
 Then again, there are lots of folks who definitely *don't* need to be
wearing anything rubber.
 
 I went to the doctor yesterday and got some samples of
[Allegra](http://www.allegra.com/). You only take one a day, and I'm
still on my first one that I took yesterday around noon. So far, it's
okay... I suppose I was hoping to be *totally* cleared up, but what I've
got going now is more of a "not-really-congested-but-still-a-tad-runny"
situation. I go to an allergy specialist next Wednesday to see if I can
get something better. I like the *idea* of the allergy shot, but I'm
deathly afraid of needles. Also, I remember my dad having to *give
himself* shots, so that's totally out of the question for me. I don't
like *receiving* shots, so there's no way I'm *giving it to myself*.
Unless it's, like, an [injection
gun](http://www.clevenet.org/med-e-jet/info.htm) of some nature. I'm not
worried so much about the pain as I am about the needle part.
 
 Finally, tomorrow is (what they bill as) the *series finale* of
[Lexx](http://www.scifi.com/lexx/). I'm sorry to see it go, but better
go out at the height of the show than wait for it to get lame. This will
also free up some TV watching time that I can allocate to something
else.
