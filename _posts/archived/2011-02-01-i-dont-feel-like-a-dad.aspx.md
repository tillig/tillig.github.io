On a somewhat daily basis, I have this weird sort of "aha!" moment where
I realize, again, that [I'm a
father](/archive/2010/12/01/phoenix-aeralynn-illig.aspx), and that's
really weird to me. I picture fathers as guys that are older than I am,
which is to say, that "being a father" somehow equates to "higher age"
even though that's obviously not remotely true. Of course, I also don't
feel like I'm really an adult yet, either, even being in my 30's, given
concerns about getting enough time to play *Rock Band* overtake my
desire to, say, watch the evening news. I own a house, too, and when I
think about that in concrete terms it weirds me out as well.

I also have a difficult time equating "baby" and "human," like Phoenix
is some sort of small animal that needs to be taken care of (like a
house cat). I find myself talking to her the way I talk to the cats,
sitting her on the couch and saying, "See, now you're on the human
chair!" when, duh, *she is a human* so of course she's on the human
chair. I think that will probably change when she has, you know, motor
control and some mechanism of communication beyond "scream."

I don't think Jenn has this sort of cognitive dissonance issue over
feeling like she's-a-mom-but-she's-not-a-mom. I think it's sort of
clicked for her. I suppose I'll get there eventually. For now, it's just
still... *surreal*.
