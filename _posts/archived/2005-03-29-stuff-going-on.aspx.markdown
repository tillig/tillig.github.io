There's lots of stuff going on lately, though no individual thing more
important or cool than any other. Just random stuff.
 
 Went to see [*Hostage*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340163/), starring
Bruce Willis. I thought it was pretty good. A little formulaic, but fun
all the same, and entertaining, which is why I pay the money to see a
movie anyway. It was out of focus just enough that it bugged me and made
me feel like my glasses were weak, but I told the theater folk and they
didn't do anything about it. It makes me want to get a job as a
projectionist just to show them what "focus" means. This is the second
movie I've sat through out of focus recently
([*Sahara*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318649/) was the other) and
it's not just me who notices.
 
 Noticed that my local Albertson's supermarket carries
[Bawls](http://www.bawls.com), which pretty much *made my week*. I
didn't succumb to ordering it online because the shipping kills you off
(drinks are heavy). But I could never find it around here. Went into the
store looking for something to eat late-night and happened to walk by
the drink case where I saw my Happy Beverage. Mmmmmmm. Love it. They
even have sugar free now, for those on diets. I haven't tried that yet.
I may have to check it out and see.
 
 Went out to dinner with Jenn's family last night for her dad's
birthday. We ate at Marie Callender's. Now, Jenn and I are trying to eat
better (and, lately, much less, since the fat content of our bodies has
sort of escaped our personal comprehension) so eating at a place where
everything is loaded in cheese sauce is probably not the most conducive
to losing weight. We ended up finding some shrimp-laden pasta that we
each only ate half of and will finish the rest for dinner. I guess if
you gotta eat a bowl of lard, it's best not to eat it all at one
sitting.
 
 After we left there, Jenn's mom gave us a nice Easter basket *full of
chocolate bars*. I appreciate the intent, but exactly what we didn't
need for Jenn's self-proclaimed lack of willpower was a big bowl full of
chocolate. Not sure what I'm going to do about that yet.
 
 Since I haven't sprung for [the hard dance
pad](http://www.buynshop.com/productinfo/44/VG-DDR-AMPD/) yet, we went
out and bought one of those plastic mats that people put in offices to
roll their chairs around on so we can set our soft dance pad on it and
maybe get a little better response from it. I've been playing a little
more (gotta get your exercise) and steps that *I know I got* don't get
counted because the mat slides around. I'm hoping this will help me
out.
