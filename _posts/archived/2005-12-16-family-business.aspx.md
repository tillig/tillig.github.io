This is more for the folks involved in this debacle, but I'm going to
just put it out there. Those who know what I'm talking about, great.
Those that don't, sorry.

 A while ago, one member of my family ("Family Member A") said something
to another member ("Family Member B"). There were actually a lot of
"somethings" said, and it has caused a rift in the family continuity.

 Whether Member A was justified or not in saying those things is between
Member A and Member B to work out. I have my feelings on the matter, but
they don't have anything to do with it. To both of them (and the rest of
the family), know this now:

 *I will not have this ridiculous awkwardness at my wedding.*

 If this shit is not figured out and addressed by the time Jenn and I
send out invitations, not everyone will be invited. And I will not
regret that decision.

 That is all.
