I participate in agile projects where we have [a daily standup
meeting](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/daily_scrum) to discuss
high-level task status and roadblocks. I've noticed that many times I
find there is a general feel that if the manager is out sick or can't
otherwise make the daily standup that the team feels the standup is
inherently canceled. When you run past their desks to find out where the
missing members are to round them up, they're astonished: "What? We're
still having a standup?"

Even if the manager is sick, even if one of the team members is out,
yes, we are still having the standup. Why am I being so jerky about it?
*It's just a standup*, right?

[Jason Yip wrote about patterns of daily standup
meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) to
address the more holistic concerns about what should and shouldn't
happen at a standup, so I won't re-hash that. Go read that article -
I'll wait.

Good. Now let me tell you what the standup means *to me* and why *I
believe* you shouldn't skip the standup.

1.  **The standup is for the team, not the manager.** It's great when
    the manager is there. And, yes, I know that in some projects you may
    not have a manager - it may be a peer scrummaster or some other
    leader. Regardless, the meeting isn't for that leader - it's for the
    team. You're not reporting your status to the manager, you're
    reporting to the team.
2.  **The standup is a vestigial sign of discipline.** In any team, it's
    important to know that your peers can meet commitments and that you
    can trust them to have your back. If you can't trust your team
    to make a simple standup, how can you trust that they're on top of
    any of the other tasks they're working on?

Now, it may be that the standup is at a bad time of day or that maybe it
should be an every-other-day standup because there's not enough
developing to warrant daily updates. It may be that there are too many
people (or too many uninvolved people). There are a lot of potential
problems with a standup's format, but those can be addressed - so
address them. Again, [the Yip
article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html)
talks about some of these problems and potential solutions.

Regardless, it is not OK to skip the standup.
