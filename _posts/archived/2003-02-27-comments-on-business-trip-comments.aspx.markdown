If that's not confusing, I don't know *what* is.

 Anyway, in response to some of the [comments made
yesterday](/archive/2003/02/26/business-trip.aspx)...

 Why don't I go to the social gatherings? A couple of reasons,
actually.

 First, I am not the socialite. It's more stressful than anything else,
and striking up conversations about things with people is nigh unto
impossible. In a business setting it's easier - talk business during
business hours. Talking business in a social setting is hard for me.

 Second, if it's anything like the other SharePoint group gatherings
I've been to (the user group, seminars, etc.), it won't offer me
anything anyway. I already have a direct line to communicate with the
product development group for SharePoint Portal Server through my work
connections; they've heard all my gripes and continue to listen. And I'm
one of the vastly more advanced users of the product - my implementation
is much larger and more convoluted than anyone else I've talked to - so
when I talk to peers about the product, I usually get reactions like,
"You solved that? I didn't even know it was possible. How did you do
it?" Then I end up teaching other people about the product rather than
learning something new myself.

 An example of that actually occurred very recently. We're working with
a contractor to do some SharePoint Portal Server stuff now. Their resume
lists several customers that they've done Portal Server stuff for. Part
of their introduction was me showing them what we currently have
implemented. They were awed - they've never done anything on this scale
yet. A lot of the stuff they didn't even know you can do. I have a
feeling I'll be doing some teaching once this project gets under way.

 Anyway, interactions like that are more value for them than me. So I'll
skip it this time. Maybe next time I'll go.

 Isn't a week alone heaven for me? Actually, I don't think it'll be too
bad in that respect. I might get a little bored since I'm used to
interacting with Jenn when I'm home and whatnot, but I'll do all right.
I'll call her on the phone or whatever. Plus, no Playstation! I think
the biggest downside will be what to do in my off-time. Maybe I'll have
to head into downtown Seattle or something and cruise around. Or maybe
I'll finally get some decent reading time in. I've been working on [*The
Sum of All
Fears*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425184226/mhsvortex)
since Christmas.
