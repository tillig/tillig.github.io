A while ago, I'm not sure when, Amazon released a "[Universal Wish List
Button](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fwishlist%2Fget-button%3Fie%3DUTF8%26%252AVersion%252A%3D1%26%252Aentries%252A%3D0&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)"
feature that allows you to add a bookmarklet to your browser and when
you see something you like, even on another web site, you can click the
bookmarklet and have it added to your Amazon wish list.

I find this feature exceptionally handy, particularly around the holiday
season when people ask what I want.

Somehow, I don't think Santa's going to be able to help me out with this
one. :)
