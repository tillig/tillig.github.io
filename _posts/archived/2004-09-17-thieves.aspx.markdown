I got in to work this morning and noticed that overnight **someone
fucking stole the [*South Park* Timmy
doll](http://www.emerchandise.com/product/DLSOP0004/s.Z4o8EatU) from my
desk**.
 
 I guess up until now I assumed that people around here had a little
common fucking courtesy and respect and wouldn't touch shit on other
peoples' desks. Now I know that's not the case.
 
 ***I'm pissed.***
 
 Does this mean I have to put up a surveillance camera on my cubicle
when I leave at night? Jeez. One would hope it wouldn't come down to
that. Do I have to take all my stuff off my desk so it doesn't get
stolen? *What the fuck?!*
