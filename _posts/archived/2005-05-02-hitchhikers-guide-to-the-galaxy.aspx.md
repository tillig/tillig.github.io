![Hitchhiker's Guide To The
Galaxy]({{ site.url }}/images/20050502h2g2.jpg)I
hate book-to-film adaptations.

 I really do. The problem is that adapting a book to film implies that
certain things will get cut due to time constraints, the general
inability to illustrate a concept visually, etc. When they do stick to
the book (like the first two *Harry Potter* movies), I love it but the
critics hate it. When they deviate from the book (like the third *Harry
Potter* movie), I hate it but the critics love it.

 I always hope they'll stick to the book because the whole reason I want
to see the film adaptation is to see the story I know and love brought
to life on the screen. One of my favorite stories ever is [*The
Hitchhiker's Guide To The
Galaxy*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345391802/mhsvortex)
and I was more than excited to see that it was going to get its time on
the big screen (not counting [the previous
time](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YUNJ/mhsvortex),
which, admittedly, I haven't seen).

 Ugh.

 I mean, seriously. Ugh.

 There was stuff that happened in the movie that never happened in the
book.

 There was stuff that happened in the movie that happened in other books
in the series.

 The worst bit is that *I've read the books* and I got lost. Jenn
*hasn't* read the books and was *more lost than me*.

 I think they were trying to get somewhere they shouldn't have tried to
go. They tried to get "creative" with it or something. They tried to
somehow change or improve upon the story and it didn't work.

 I liked [Martin Freeman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293509/) as Arthur
Dent. [Mos Def](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080049/) as Ford Prefect
was... well, he wasn't what I pictured when I read the books, but I
bought it. [Zooey Deschanel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221046/) was a
great Trillian. [Bill Nighy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490/) as
Slartibartfast was *perfect* (and has my vote for most accurately
represented character in the movie).

 On the other hand, [Sam Rockwell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005377/)
as Zaphod Beeblebrox left something to be desired. He felt too...
flashy... and not enough "used car salesman." The rendition of Marvin
the Paranoid Android was not remotely how I had pictured Marvin in the
books. And the spaceship Heart Of Gold had pretty much no bearing on
anything I had imagined.

 The Vogons, who are an interesting set of characters, were not major
players in the books. I mean, they were *there*, but they didn't show up
every 10 seconds. In the movie, the Vogons filled in the "villain" role
and were on screen almost more than the humans.

 I won't even get into the fact that the dolphins played like NO role in
the first book but somehow made it to the *opening credits* of the
movie.

 I really hope they don't try this again. I won't even be picking this
up on DVD, it was so bad. Sorry, Hollywood, you really lost me here. Now
I'm going to have a hell of a time convincing Jenn to read the books.
