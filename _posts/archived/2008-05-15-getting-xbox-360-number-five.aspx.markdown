Over the past few weeks I've noticed that, more and more often, my Xbox
360 will hang and give me an error message saying "the disc is
unreadable" and inform me that I should clean the disc. Normally I'd say
I have some pretty dirty discs, but the times it's doing it, the discs
are brand new - not even a single scratch. Eject the disc and pop it
back in and it's fixed. No cleaning required.

It's averaging about every hour-and-a-half of game play now. I might
play for four hours without interruption one day, but the next day it'll
happen two or three times in an hour. Since it's really starting to get
annoying (and seems to be happening at some pretty inopportune times,
like just after you beat a really hard mission but before you can save),
I called Xbox Support.

I'll be sending my console in for repairs, this time for a failing DVD
drive. This is the second bad DVD drive I've had. Let's see...

    (didn't require a new Xbox, but still)

...and now we've come full circle with a bad DVD drive.

The box to ship my console back to them should arrive tomorrow, per the
UPS site. I'll probably play through the weekend and then send it back.
It's not unplayable, just super annoying, and I'm *so close* to
finishing the story missions in *GTA4*.
