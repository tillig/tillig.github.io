Some of you (but probably not a lot) have read [Max
Barry's](http://www.maxbarry.com) novel, [*Jennifer
Government*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385507593/mhsvortex).
If you haven't, I highly recommend it.

 For those who have read it, there's a web game out, written by the
author, that's based on the novel. Check it out:
