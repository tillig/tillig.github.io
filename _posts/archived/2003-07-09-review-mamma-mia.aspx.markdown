[*Mamma Mia!*](http://www.mamma-mia.com) is a musical production that
tells the story of a girl getting married who has never met her father.
She finds out that there are three men who potentially could be her
father, so she invites them all to her wedding and proceeds to try to
figure out which one is going to walk her down the aisle.
 
 The thing about *Mamma Mia!*, though, is that the music is all
[ABBA](http://www.abbasite.com/) music - so when you go in, you already
know the words to the songs, and you can't help but tap your toe.
 
 Now, I've seen several Broadway-style productions including [*Jesus
Christ
Superstar*](http://www.reallyuseful.com/disp.cgi?page=jesuschristsuperstar/main.html)
and [*Phantom of the Opera*](http://www.thephantomoftheopera.com/). I've
seen almost every Cirque du Soleil show out there. So going into *Mamma
Mia!*, I had a certain level of expectation for the showmanship that
they were going to present to me.
 
 And... eh. See, I love the music, but I expected to see huge singing
and dancing numbers, right? Choreography and lights and music and
action! But what I got was more like... four people or thereabouts, max,
on stage during any given song (with a couple exceptions), and several
of the songs delivered in a "soliloquy" format, where the stage goes
dark except for one spotlight on the singer, who stands stock-still (no
arm or head movement), delivers the song over the audience's head, then
returns to position and the action continues. A lot of the time I felt
like whispering, "Psst! Pssssst! ACT!"
 
 That said, there were some great laughs and it was a nice story they
told, so I wasn't *disappointed*, it just wasn't what I *expected*.
Jenn, on the other hand, came out totally wowed and loved every second.
Expectations can definitely influence your view of a thing.
