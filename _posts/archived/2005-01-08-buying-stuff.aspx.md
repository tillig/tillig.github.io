The holiday season has come and gone, and while the money's still a
little tight, I decided to commit to buy a few things with some money
I'd saved up for the purpose combined with some gift certificates and
other money I got for Christmas.

 First on the list, I special ordered (from [Magnolia
Audio/Video](http://www.magnoliahifi.com/)) the [Bose Acoustimass 16
series 6.1 speaker
system](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006L7RX/mhsvortex).
They said it'd take a couple of weeks to get here, so it's not in place
*yet*, but I'm *very* anxious. It's on the way.

 Then I took an [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes) gift card I got
from my mom and I've been getting songs and stuff. That's fun, and I can
see where it would become addictive. Like, it's "only a dollar" for a
song, but I could easily nickel-and-dime myself to death. The only
downside is the stupid 128kbps sample rate; all of my stuff is 256kbps
AAC, and if I'm buying songs where I'll never have the original CD to
resample, I'd at least like a really high quality digital file.

 Of course, in the purchasing of songs I realized that there were a
couple of CDs I wanted, and I haven't bought a CD in a long time, so I
ordered [*Bobby Brown's Greatest
Hits*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YLOX/mhsvortex) and
the new Avril Lavigne album, [*Under My
Skin*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001UL7RY/mhsvortex).
Both are excellent and have been rocking my iPod since.

had bought a shirt for Jenn for Christmas but I got her the wrong size,
so I gave that one to my sister and Jenn decided she wanted a [The Cheat
shirt](http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/cheat.html) instead, so I
got her that. While I was there, I got myself a copy of the first [100
Strong Bad Emails DVD
set](http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/dvddvddvd.html). How could I
pass?

 And, of course, I got a GameCube for Christmas, and it came with a gift
certificate for $15 off a game, so I went to the local Target and
picked up [*Pac Man
Fever*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FWTY/mhsvortex) and
[*Mario Golf: Toadstool
Tour*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009PS22/mhsvortex).
Both are fun, and Jenn and I regularly compete at golf. Neither of us
are all that good, but it's a lot of fun.

 In other news, it was my friend Stuart's birthday yesterday, so we took
him out to lunch at work, and tonight we're going Cosmic Bowling. Should
be fun.
