I wasn't originally taken with the whole *Harry Potter* concept. I mean,
a children's book about magic and stuff... doesn't sound too appealing.
I decided it wasn't worth the time.
 
 But then I saw [the
movie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXI1/mhsvortex).
 
 After that, I needed to read the books. I ended up ordering them from
[Amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk) because a) they had the fourth
book in paperback already and b) I wanted to read the books the original
way they were written.
 
 I was not disappointed.
 
 I won't go into the whole "no series has sucked me in like that for a
long time" rant. You've heard it all before.
 
 What it *did* spawn, though, besides that, was a series of
[Legos](http://www.lego.com/harrypotter/) that are really cool.
Miniature Lego Harry and Hermione? How can I pass that up?
 
 Of course, there was a huge run on them during the Christmas season, so
while I got a couple of sets for Christmas, when I went back to the
store to complete my collection, they were sold out. I ended up
successfully [ordering them online](http://shop.lego.com/), with a few
of the sets backordered.
 
 I finally have all the sets now.
 
 I set them up at work in my cube. They look pretty good, and I put them
all together to make one giant set just like in the pictures on the box.
Yeah! I dug it so much, I decided some photos were in order. Since I
only have a crappy little webcam, the pictures aren't *too great*, but
they'll do.

 ![All the Legos, all
together!](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pkU8oh_2VxKBP8UD4DWOOEacR6OV-9Wn80K5iX6U9MIT9CQCMxLOytE75eFPX4GOQjDtF30IfScCXbKvqRskkq9TH5xFBH_TqVmksqcrvHV0/20020301legosyo4.jpg?psid=1)
 
 Looks pretty good, huh? I thought so.
 
 On a side note, that sort of spurs a question of what the rest of my
workspace looks like. From over by the Legos, if you look at where I sit
eight hours a day, it looks like this.

 Yeah, that is a lava lamp. And a
[Luminglas](http://www.strattman.com/products/luminglas1.html). And a
disco ball. And a mirror ball. Here's a closer look.

 Lots of folks find it distracting. I think it's boring if all that
stuff *isn't* there. Heh.
