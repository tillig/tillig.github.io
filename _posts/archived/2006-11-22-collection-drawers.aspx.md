![Single Collection Drawer
Box]({{ site.url }}/images/20061122drawerbox.gif)I'm
a comic geek (you'd never have guessed, *right*?) and I've got a closet
upstairs full of comic long boxes that make it a super pain to file
comics as I get them.

 Was over at [Aaron's](http://aaron.jensenopolis.com/wp/) house last
night and my world was turned around when he showed me [Collection
Drawers](http://www.collectiondrawer.com): Comic boxes designed to stack
and pull out like drawers, greatly easing the filing system.

 I'm totally ordering these.
