![Single Collection Drawer
Box](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2p95APJoBwcDc4GXX7rFriXQ6-OpWnyn1EHlPrGgEiKnzLvY5wo2hVW4Ik43BaP9JyD16B9VBXKYy9uzTmrarOpljlGPgkCbfRcqyiTsmYhF0/20061122drawerbox.gif?psid=1)I'm
a comic geek (you'd never have guessed, *right*?) and I've got a closet
upstairs full of comic long boxes that make it a super pain to file
comics as I get them.

 Was over at [Aaron's](http://aaron.jensenopolis.com/wp/) house last
night and my world was turned around when he showed me [Collection
Drawers](http://www.collectiondrawer.com): Comic boxes designed to stack
and pull out like drawers, greatly easing the filing system.

 I'm totally ordering these.
