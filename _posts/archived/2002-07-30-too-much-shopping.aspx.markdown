I went on a mission last night to find my [Ottawa Senators home
jersey](http://shop.nhl.com/itmModelList.asp?s={2652B09B-A8F3-4F79-AE65-C35B857C07D3}&l=1&a=10088&c=8036&sf=2&cnl=3&i=10279)
but failed miserably. I am surprised at all the myriad baseball,
basketball, and football paraphernalia found at sports fan stores around
and the *distinct lack* of hockey or soccer stuff. Not that I'm a soccer
fan, but those two sports seem vastly underrepresented in the
merchandising arena, at least in the Portland, Oregon area.

 So after calling around to some places this morning, I ended up
ordering it off the [NHL site](http://www.nhl.com). There were other
sites that had Ottawa jerseys, but none had the home jersey. So, NHL it
is.

 I also started cashing in my [Yahoo! Visa](http://visa.yahoo.com)
points for [SuperCertificates](http://www.giftcertificates.com) so I can
buy the [James Bond Collection, Vol.
1](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BH8G/mhsvortex), from
Amazon. Once I get those points cashed in, I'll probably order that and
my copy of [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice
City*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000696CZ/mhsvortex)
since they both come out within three days of each other.

 And I ordered [*The Bourne Identity* (the TV
miniseries)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006AG8D/mhsvortex)
and [a
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552999067/mhsvortex) from
the [Barnes and Noble site](http://www.bn.com) because they're offering
free shipping on any two items you order, which I find more acceptable
than Amazon's current promotion of free shipping for orders over \$49.
Barnes and Noble was more expensive for each item, but with the free
shipping thing I saved, like, a buck or two.

 I really need to stop buying things. I'm actually putting quite a cap
on the stuff I've bought lately since I got my frickin' Visa bill. YOW!
Time to make use of the things I have and stop getting new things. Of
course, not buying stuff means not going too many places, which is fine
with me, but Jenn gets a little restless at times. Besides which, the
stuff I like to do at home (reading, art projects, PS2, etc.) is usually
inherently one person stuff, and it would be nice to involve Jenn in the
stuff I'm doing.

 Oh, well. Such is life.
