[![The XO laptop - One Laptop Per Child
program.]({{ site.url }}/images/20071114olpc.jpg)](http://www.laptopgiving.org)The
[One Laptop Per Child foundation](http://www.laptop.org/) has their
["Give One, Get One"
program](http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/give-one-get-one.php) going on
where you buy two of these little XO laptops and one comes to your
house, one gets donated to a child in a developing country.  It's $400,
and $200 of that is tax-deductible (the cost of the laptop that gets
sent to the developing country).  The rest goes toward the laptop that
hits your hot little hands.  (Ostensibly to give to a child in your
life, but for me it's more likely a toy to hack.)

A charity to help teach kids computing skills? Oh, *hellz yeah*.  I
bought mine; have you got yours?
