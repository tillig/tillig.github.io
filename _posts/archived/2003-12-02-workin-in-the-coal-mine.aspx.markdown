I'm still at work because traffic is terrible out there and I'd rather
sit around here and get stuff done than sit in a car indefinitely. Ugh.

 I was reading the [blog of a friend of
mine](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=bb8adb58-45e0-484b-b46f-5c7187eb7c4c)
and it brought up an interesting question. Where do you work best?

 For him, he works best "out of his element" - traveling, sitting at
Starbucks, in someone else's cube, etc.

 For me, it's a whole other story. If I'm out of my element (i.e.,
working at home or out of the office), while I will be more likely to
come up with solutions to nagging problems, the amount of code I will
churn out will be \*less\* than if I'm sitting in my sensory deprivation
chamber at work. Why? Call it ADHD - there are too many things "out
there" that I'd rather be doing than sitting and coding... Art projects,
working on my own personal code projects, playing with my cat, watching
movies, playing games, etc.

 Being at work, I have more of a sense of dedication to the task at hand
- I'm at work *so I can work*.

 I think I solve my problems best in the shower or in the car in the
morning. I'll figure out how to deal with stuff I'm stuck on while I'm
driving to work in the morning or coming home at night. (Actually,
sitting on the pot's a great place to solve problems, too.) Once I'm
going to code, though, I need to put the headphones on (music with no
words - trance/techno seems to be best for me) and not answer the phone
or see any distractions around me. Otherwise, the workflow goes kaput.
