I decided to keep a tally this year of how many trick-or-treaters showed
up to the house this year. Between 6:00p (when I got home and started
serving) and 8:00p (when the frequency of arrivals slowed enough to
warrant shutting down) we had 155 kids.
 
 Of course, probably 15 of those were probably old enough to be tried as
adults for any crime by a jury of their peers (hint: high school means
no more trick-or-treating), so let's use quotes around "kids."
 
 One kid was pretty lippy, too. Probably nine years old or so, he shows
up and I answer the door in my Wonka costume. I hand out the candy and
just before leaving, he strikes up conversation:
 
 **Kid**: Who are you supposed to be?
 **Me**: Willy Wonka.
 **Kid**: I hate that guy. He's queer. [Kid exits stage left.]
 
 Give me back that candy, you prepubescent asshole.
 
 Aside from that, all went well. I realize now that the tally would have
been much more interesting had I charted the number of kids who showed
up both by general age group and time so I could see the trends from
year to year, but maybe that's just overengineering the thing.
 
 We didn't run out of candy this year, which was good (we did last
year). We did go through about six pounds, though. Jenn's going to take
the remains to work so we don't pig on it at home.
