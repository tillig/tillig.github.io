[Twitter recently added the ability to force
HTTPS](http://www.securityweek.com/twitter-enables-option-https-default),
thereby thwarting wireless traffic sniffers like Firesheep.

Log into Twitter, [go to your account settings
page](http://twitter.com/settings/account), and check the box at the
bottom marked "Always use HTTPS."

While you're at it, [go set Facebook to use HTTPS
only](http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=486790652130) and [enable
two-factor authentication on your Google
account](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html).
