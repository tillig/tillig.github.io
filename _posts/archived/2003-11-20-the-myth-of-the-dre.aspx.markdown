After badgering my boss (Greg - I'll name him by name this time because
he's been bitching about how I refer to him here like he's two different
people) to try *Time Crisis 3* out on his PS2 for a couple of days, he
finally did and called me up last night to tell me that...
 
 It worked.
 
 So it's not a problem with the game at all, but, rather, a problem with
*my Playstation 2*, which I had a feeling was the case.
 
 The thing is, I'm not at all comfortable with cracking that thing open
to fix it, clean it, or what have you. I found

[of](http://www.gamingworldx.com/features/PlayStation2DiscReadErrorDRERepairGuide.shtml)
[guides](http://www.arstechnica.com/news/posts/1068171596.html) telling
me how to fix it, ranging from a simple cleaning to adjusting gears to
messing with the laser voltage, but none of them really made me keen on
dealing with this thing.
 
 Then I found that there's a [class action
lawsuit](http://www.geocities.com/techboi88/index2.html) against Sony
for exactly this reason ([official site
here](http://www.gttlawyers.com/class_playstation.htm)). Turns out, you
can get [a free repair from
Sony](http://dw.com.com/redir?asid=915821&astid=8&siteid=19&edid=107&destCat=26621&destURL=http%3A%2F%2Fdb.gamefaqs.com%2Fconsole%2Fps2%2Ffile%2Fplaystation2_sony_repair.txt)
if you call them and complain about it. I think I'm going to try that
out before I commit to cracking it open or doing anything rash.
 
 The more I read about it, the more irritated I get. This seems like a
*vastly common* issue. Makes me wonder if Sony engineered them poorly
specifically to get consumers to buy more units.
