I don't religiously analyze my blog stats, but every time I do go check
out who's looking at what, I'm always interested in the search terms
that bring people to my site.

The weird thing is, far and away, the most used search term/phrase
bringing people in to my site is:

> **you don't have to be rich to be my girl**

Like, lyrics from the Prince song, "Kiss." It takes people to [this
article I
wrote](/archive/2002/03/22/you-dont-have-to-be-rich-to-be-my-girl.aspx)
like six years ago about how I picked up a Tom Jones CD that had his
cover version of "Kiss" on it. I get so much traffic to it that it's
always in the top five articles hit on my site.

In fact, if you [Google that
phrase](http://www.google.com/search?q=you+don%27t+have+to+be+rich+to+be+my+girl),
I'm currently the \#1 result:

![Google results for "you don't have to be rich to be my
girl"](https://hyqi8g.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2pdAHFAIGjvRKMK5b8VaASCMT-sI2hKW1xQZkicE1nhevUtMU3Kw7fNqOf-eUJmuRoqiQU-lC8HCoRlj4YcarJNfvh12McWokiFcCshwb9iDQ/20080516rich.jpg?psid=1)

What are the crazy search terms that bring people to your site?
