Sitting here in a minor state of hypnosis (taking a short breather
between massive server upgrade projects), I decided that I definitely
need to get a [Tom Jones](http://www.tomjones.com/) album. Something
about his rendition of Prince's song *Kiss* not only gets me movin', but
cracks me up at the same time. (Yeah, yeah, that was actually "Art of
Noise *featuring* Tom Jones" but still...)
 
 Besides, any guy who can get [panties thrown at him everywhere he
goes](http://www.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/10/19/tomjones/)
deserves a little respect.
 
 Maybe I'll go do that today.
 
 Bit of a follow-up from yesterday: I found a [website that has the Tron
figure collection](http://www.emerchandise.com/browse/TRON/ACTIONFI/)
for dirt cheap! I ended up buying all the rest of them. To make up for
lost time. Or something. Just a sec, I'll justify it...
 
 Oh, and a while back I tried to listen to some of the vinyl albums in
my collection and [the
turntable](http://www.compassnet.com/concept/tables/1215s.htm) didn't
start up. I thought it might be a fuse or something (it's like 20 years
old if it's a day), but it turns out there's this little pin that's
connected to the A/C plug that came unsoldered. Of course, it's too
small to solder yourself, so I started looking for spare parts.
 
 Good luck finding spare parts for a 20 year old turntable.
 
 I *did*, however, find the same model turntable that a guy was selling
online for \$55 (which is a real bargain if you've ever priced
turntables). I decided to buy it since that way I'll have spare parts
for the *next time* this thing goes dead.
 
 And I continue to progress through the world of [Grand Theft Auto
III](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/). Last night I
hijacked an ice cream truck and bombed four gangsters, ran a mission as
a limo driver being chased by the Triads, and [barely] won a street
race. Admittedly, I'm feeling pretty accomplished. (Those Triad guys in
the game, though, are real bitches. I just drive through that section of
town and they shoot at me. The next mission I've got is to kill 25 of
them in two minutes using a flamethrower. The problem there is that I
can't frickin' find 25 of them. They all run like scared little girls.)
 
 I wonder if Tom Jones plays GTA3... Hmmmm....
