So Jenn and I were folding our clean laundry last night before bed. We
had probably three big loads of stuff to put away and, lazy people that
we are, we decided that it probably would be okay if we just did it
later.

 During the folding effort, though, I realized I didn't have any clean
socks. I proceeded to dump out the load of whites (one of the loads we
had decided to do later) and fold it. Jenn was all, "What are you doing?
We're going to fold those later!" I told her I had no socks left. Her
response: "Well, then, just dump the socks out of that load and fold
those."

 How am I supposed to dump *just the socks* out of a load of laundry?
That would mean I need to get some sort of *sock colander* that allows
me to dump a whole load of laundry into it and have just the socks
trickle through.

 But since that wasn't in the cards, we ended up just folding the whole
load and calling it a day.
