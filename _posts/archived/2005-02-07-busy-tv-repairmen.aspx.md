I hadn't heard back from the TV repair people on when they'd be
scheduling [my repair](/archive/2005/02/07/tv-lines-not-parallel.aspx),
so I just now called them.

 Tuesday, February 15. Over a week from now.

 Last time I pinged them earlier in the morning on Monday and they got
to me in three days. Now it's eight. Next time (if there is a next
time), I'm calling every 15 minutes first thing Monday to get in.

 So I wait. Hopefully the picture distortion won't just drive me
absolutely buggy in the meantime.
