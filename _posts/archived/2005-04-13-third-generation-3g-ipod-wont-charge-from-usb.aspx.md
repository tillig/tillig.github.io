I bought one of the fourth generation (4G) iPods - the 60GB iPod Photo -
and it came with a USB charger and a USB-to-dock connector cable. I
plugged it in, attached the iPod, and it charged right up.

 Later, I tried to attach Jenn's iPod (my 3G 15GB iPod) to that charger
to charge it up, and it doesn't charge - it stays on, but it doesn't
charge.

 Turns out this is a [known
issue](http://forums.ipodlounge.com/showthread.php?s=5863bf759efc3350a9fc3c7bfad29eba&threadid=89839).
The [Apple Store page for the USB
charger](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?productLearnMore=M9837LL/A)
says it "supports iPod shuffle, iPod mini, iPod photo and iPod with
click wheel." Which subtly excludes 3G iPods (they don't have a "click
wheel").

 Interesting that they don't outright say anything about this anywhere
in the official Apple support section. You'd think more people would
wonder about this.
