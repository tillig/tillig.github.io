I was looking forward to seeing something from MortgageDesignGroup today
as I was promised on Friday, but it's 5:00p, end of the business day,
and I haven't gotten anything.
 
 On the other hand, I got a call from Ann this morning and she was
*exceptionally* up front with me on some things that I hadn't heard from
anyone else.
 
 The question was how flexible she could be on some of the closing costs
and broker fees. She said that, frankly, she could make them all go
entirely away. With that, though, is a sort of caveat. She likened it to
a car dealership: You might get the dealer to give you a lower price and
cut his overhead more than he'd like, but that rebate you might have
qualified for... you suddenly don't qualify for anymore. Basically, you
might not pay the fees and closing costs up front, but you may end up
paying it anyway in the loan's percentage rate.
 
 It sounds kind of crappy, but I won't lie to you - I'd rather someone
be honest with me than try to sell me into something of a lower value. I
appreciated her honesty on that one.
 
 And with that, I think I've picked my broker. Sure, I'll wait to see if
MDG sends me anything, but I have a very, very strong feeling I'll be
calling Ann back to ask what next steps will be. Jenn pointed out that,
of all of the brokers I've talked to, the only one that doesn't stress
me out when I talk about her is Ann. I think that says something right
there.
 
 In other news, I've scheduled with the realtor to do a couple of
walkthroughs this coming Saturday - houses he recommended that Jenn and
I drove past this weekend. In the meantime, he'll continue looking for
stuff in our desired area and maybe we'll have more to see when we meet
up with him this weekend.
