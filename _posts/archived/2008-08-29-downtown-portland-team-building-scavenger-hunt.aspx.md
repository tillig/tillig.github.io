[![The Red Team: Jeff, Derek, Me (Travis), and
Devin](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/2808087757_9b636f65c8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/websteria/sets/72157607011326559/)Yesterday
the entire [Voyager User Solutions and
Infrastructure teams](http://www.checkfree.com) went downtown Portland
to do a photo scavenger hunt. We were broken up into three teams - Red,
Yellow, and Blue, and ran around taking pictures of ourselves with
various landmarks.

Jeff, Derek, I, and Devin were on the Red Team.

We started out at [Pioneer Place](http://www.pioneerplace.com) around
noon for lunch, then at 1:00p met up in [Pioneer Courthouse
Square](http://www.pioneercourthousesquare.org/) to get our clue packets
and get moving. From then until about 3:30p we went everywhere from
[Powell's Books](http://www.powells.com/) to [Skidmore
Fountain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore_Fountain) to the
[Portland Art Museum](http://www.pam.org/) and the [Oregon Historical
Society](http://www.ohs.org/) getting
[pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/websteria/sets/72157607011326559/).

After an extremely exhausting day, all of the teams reconvened at the
[Pinocchio Bar and
Restaurant](http://www.pinocchiobarandrestaurant.com/) for happy hour
and dinner.

A great time was had by all. We learned a few things about Portland that
we didn't know (and I've lived here my entire life!) and came out all
the better for it.

Maybe next time we'll go skydiving.... nah.
