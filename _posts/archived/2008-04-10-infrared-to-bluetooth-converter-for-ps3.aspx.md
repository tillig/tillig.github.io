As I'm thinking about getting a PS3 soon, I know I'm going to want to
control the Blu-ray portion with my standard universal remote.
Unfortunately, PS3 uses Bluetooth for its controllers and doesn't
support standard IR remotes.

[IR2BT to the rescue.](http://ir2bt.com/) It converts IR signals to
Bluetooth specifically for this purpose. I can get one of those instead
of yet-another-proprietary-remote.
