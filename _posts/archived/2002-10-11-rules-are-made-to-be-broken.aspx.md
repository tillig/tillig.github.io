[*The Transporter*](http://www.transportermovie.com) is out tonight and
my dad and I will be going to see it. I'm stoked. I'm hoping it's as
badass as it looks in the trailers. Usually [Luc
Besson](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Besson,+Luc) movies are, but I'm
noticing this was directed by [Corey
Yuen](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Yuen,%20Corey), whoever that is (looks
like he's done a lot of Hong Kong action stuff). Either way, I'm ready
to go.

 Watched [*Survivor*](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor5/) last
night on [my new
TV](http://www.sonystyle.com/home/item.jsp?hierc=9685x9800x9801&catid=9801&itemid=36589&type=o)

- the first real show I've gotten to just sit down and watch since I got
the thing hooked up. It was the bomb. Didn't hurt that they voted that
whiny bitch
[Ghandia](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor5/survivors/bios/ghandia.shtml)
out, either. Now if they will just vote
[Robb](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor5/survivors/bios/robb.shtml)
out...
