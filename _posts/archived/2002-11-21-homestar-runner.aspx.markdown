For those who have a little extra time and bandwidth, check out
[Homestar Runner](http://www.homestarrunner.com/) for some pretty funny
cartoons. They're in Flash, and they do use sound, so make sure you can
hear what's going on. I haven't found anything "dirty" on there, so if
you can only check it out at work, I think it's okay.

 Unless, of course, you'll get fired anyway.

 Maybe you should try it, regardless.

 My favorite ones are "[Strong Bad's
Email](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html)" where this
character, Strong Bad, answers letters. Again, the audio is key here. I
was rolling after watching the
"[Guitar](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail36.html)" episode; almost
as funny as [Turd Ferguson](/archive/2002/08/27/turd-ferguson.aspx).

 Speaking of Turd Ferguson, I never was able to find an electronic
version of that skit. If anyone's got one, let me know. I still wanna
make Turd Ferguson t-shirts.
