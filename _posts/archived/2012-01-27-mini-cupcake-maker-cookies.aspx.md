[![Mini cupcake
maker](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61BGkRGBWsL._AA300_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002E1PJ8Q?tag=mhsvortex)If
you happen to have [one of these mini cupcake
makers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002E1PJ8Q?tag=mhsvortex), you can put
a dollop of cookie dough in each of the cupcake spots and 11 minutes
later â€“ cookies.

You may have to "pop" the tops on them at around 8 minutes. They usually
bubble a bit.

There was some highly scientific culinary experimentation involved in
arriving at that 11 minute point. Earlier and they just fall apart;
later and the cookies are pretty hard.

Note we didn't use liners, we just threw the dough right in.

Oh, and they don't turn out pretty. But tasty!
