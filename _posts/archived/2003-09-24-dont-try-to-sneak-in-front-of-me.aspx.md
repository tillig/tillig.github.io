I was driving in to work thinking, "Man, it's already Wednesday and I
haven't found a Traffic Asshole yet. Well, hello! It's like the devil
knows you're thinking about him."

 There, in a feeble attempt to pass, was the Traffic Asshole.

 We were coming up on a pretty heavy interchange where not only does a
major highway merge with the one we were on, but the road goes from
three lanes down to two. (Yeah, we can discuss the logistics of the
traffic planners later. I've got a beef with them myself.) Anyway, this
guy saw that there was a huge truck hauling cars that was merging in
front of him, so he zoomed up alongside me and tried to get into the
narrowing gap between me and the car in front of me.

 Fuck that, man. You get back where you belong.

 He ended up having to merge in behind me. God forbid the guy get in
behind where there's *nobody*, he wanted to get into the tiny space *in
front of me*. Asshole.

 We eventually get past that bottleneck and the road thins out a bit, so
he decides it's time to pass again. By this time, I had the camera out
because I was going to try to get a rear view mirror pic of the guy.
That was when he made his move, so I aimed the camera out the side and
shot...

 Voila! A perfect side view of the Traffic Asshole of the Week! (I'm
pretty amazed that turned out. He was moving past pretty fast so I only
got the one picture.)

 Of course, as is usually the case when assholes want to pass, they pass
really quickly and don't realize *the traffic is stopped up there*. If
you could have gotten through up there, *you'd be there*, right? Some
people never learn.

 Gotta love people.
