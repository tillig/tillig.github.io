I did this network upgrade of my primary workstation to Windows XP
Professional so I could test the deployment that we're going to use to
upgrade the whole company. In the process, I found that the upgrade
seemed to have broken some of the software on the computer, so I started
looking at fixing it. Eventually I ended up opening a support call with
Microsoft because it was just not getting fixed.

 I got a support rep on the phone this morning and we started
reinstalling certain components to see if we could get things back up
and running. At one point I rebooted the machine and saw this message:

 *The hard drive controller detects imminent failure of the disk. Please
backup your data and replace the drive.*

 Uh oh. I don't like that at all. But, fine, most of my stuff's already
backed up anyway (at least, the mission-critical stuff is), so I wasn't
too worried. I hit the key to continue booting the machine...

 ... and it wouldn't come up. It just wasn't working. So now I've got a
new hard drive in the machine and I'm rebuilding the whole thing from
scratch.

 This is *exactly* what I wanted to be doing today.
