I went after work yesterday and picked up the [strategy guide for *Grand
Theft Auto: San
Andreas*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0744004292/mhsvortex).
 
 This thing is a monster. 272 pages. About an inch thick. By way of
comparison, the [strategy guide for the previous GTA
game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0744001943/mhsvortex) is
only 176 pages.
 
 I've refrained from playing the game, though, saving it for next week.
Or at least this weekend. I know that if I start now, I'll never stop.
Like an addict falling off the wagon. (Where did the phrase "falling off
the wagon" come from? Was there some wagon that addicts got on at some
point?)
 
 In the meantime, I've gone on a minor Amazon spending spree, cashing in
on the [Yahoo! Visa](http://visa.yahoo.com) points I've acquired over
the past year. To satisfy my cravings, I bought: [the seventh season
(and final) of *Buffy the Vampire
Slayer*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002XVKMC/mhsvortex),
indicating the end to a lot of money spent until the next killer show
rolls around; a [*Star Wars* Millennium
Falcon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00020LZ6Q/mhsvortex)
(for the 3.75" figures - I never had one when I was a kid and now I
really want one); and, on strong recommendation from [a friend of
mine](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/), the [Sony RM-VL900 learning
remote](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005I9Q0/mhsvortex),
since I'm sick and tired of having to juggle - seriously - six different
remotes because I can't find a damn remote that just *does everything*.
 
 I tried for the "Super Saver Shipping" deal on Amazon, where you get
free shipping with your order over \$50, but it would only end up saving
me like \$3. Somehow I bought a load of stuff that doesn't qualify for
the free shipping. (Granted, the Falcon comes from Toys R Us and the
remote comes from DynaDirect, but *come on*.)
 
 Thus, I am looking forward to cool things showing up in my mailbox very
soon.
 
 In other news, we watched
[*Lost*](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index.html) last night, and
after having missed two or three weeks' worth of shows, I don't feel
like I'm behind. Strange, but maybe the little "previously on *Lost*"
segment at the beginning of the show summed things up. Then again, from
the hour-long show I watched, I didn't see a whole lot of plot
progression. It was mostly some background and development on the
characters themselves, giving insight as to why the people are the way
they are. Interesting stuff, but you could sum up in a couple of short
clips the development that occurred relating to the island itself.
Intriguing, nonetheless.
