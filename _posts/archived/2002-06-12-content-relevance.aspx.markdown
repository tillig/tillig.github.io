While waiting for this program I'm writing to run a few test iterations,
I started to sort of re-read a few of the blog entries that I've got up
here and began to think - you know, unless you're related to me or know
me in some form, this stuff won't really matter to you. The context is
lacking.
 
 That's pretty much what it says in the [Libertarian Blog
Manifesto](http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/stein5.html). (Granted, it's
got a little more politically-related propaganda strewn about in there,
but, pretty much, that's the sum of it.) I tend to agree - if you don't
know me, you probably *won't* care for what's going on around here, as
is evidenced by the negative "karma" rating that most of my entries
get.
 
 Unless you decide to take the time to read up on this stuff and *[get
to know me](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/88/88tknowme.phtml)*. Then
it'll all make hella more sense and you might enjoy it.
 
 At the same time, the whole reason I've got this thing going on is so I
can keep folks updated about *me* without having to write 30,000 emails
every day with the same thing in every one of them. And, frankly, if you
don't like it, *tough crap*.
 
 Now, that said, if y'all wanna hear about something, I'd be more than
happy to write somethin' up. But no one leaves comments or anything
saying one way or the other, so I'll just plod along and do my thang
until such time arises.

that](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXA2/mhsvortex).
