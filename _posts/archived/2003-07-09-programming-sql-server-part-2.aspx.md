I forgot to post yesterday's class log, but there wasn't much, so I'll
just throw it up here and call it good.

 *9:40a*

 I went to see [*Jet Lag*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0293116) last night
as my first assignment as a movie reviewer for
[YouBored.com](http://www.youbored.com). All in all, I thought it was
pretty good, but you'll have to wait for the formal review to show up on
YouBored. If it never shows, well, I'll post 'er here so the effort's
not lost. One thing I will say: [Juliette
Binoche](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Binoche,%20Juliette)... MMMMMMM.....

 Something I need to bring out in the open, here, since it's bothering
me...

 How come fat and/or old men *have to* breathe very, very loudly out of
their mouths while they're taking a leak? I mean, these guys could be
doing a 500 pound clean-and-jerk for all the huffing and puffing they're
doing. Does pissing really require that much noise? Get that shit under
control. I was just in the bathroom with this guy who walks about three
feet an hour, probably a good hundred pounds overweight, and this guy
sounds like he's running a marathon while he's doing his business. I
couldn't pee fast enough and get out of there.

 *11:41a*

 Class is heavy, sort of like the last class, but I'm not feeling as
swamped because we're getting the time to do the labs. Plus, since a lot
of this is feeling familiar (which I think is a Good Thing), it's a lot
easier than the last class.

 I got my self testing software yesterday so I can start to take
practice tests and quiz myself in getting ready for the actual tests. I
think after this class is over, I'll spend next week prepping myself for
the test (in the evenings) and get that scheduled. I'd like to get these
things behind me so my nerves aren't piqued.

 *1:17p*

 Two-person class + No questions = Short days, which is just fine with
me.

 I've continued working on and off with the revised CSS layout of the
site and I think it's pretty much done, but I'm too much of a chicken to
put it up. Because that means going through and doing these major
changes, and if it doesn't fix everything then it's going to be a big
pain in the ass. Of course, if I don't put the stupid thing up, I'm
never going to figure out what I've left out, so maybe I should just do
it.

 I think I'll back up the site first, though. At least the templates.
