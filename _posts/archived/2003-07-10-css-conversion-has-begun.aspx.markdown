You may notice a few changes and potentially errors in the formatting of
the site. That's because I've started converting the layout and color
scheme over to use Cascading Style Sheets instead of tables. To the
uninitiated, what that means is that I'll be able to more easily change
the colors, look, and feel of my site at a later time. What it also
means is that I'm starting to save a little more space on my server,
which prolongs the inevitable move to a hosted environment. I'm not even
done with the reformat on the templates and I've already saved about 2MB
- just from removing some static HTML that didn't need to be there.

 Anyway, I'm going to continue reformatting this thing, but it'll be a
bit before it's totally complete (maybe several days) so bear with me.
I've gotten the majority of the stuff worked out all right.

 Oh, and check out your Print Preview - if your browser supports CSS
properly, you should see the page reformatted to work better on your
printer!
