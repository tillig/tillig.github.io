I come across this sort of thing and always feel behind the times.

 [Google has this 3D modeling program called SketchUp that is apparently
already on version 6.](http://sketchup.google.com/intl/en/index.html) I
haven't tried it yet, but it looks like it's pretty easy to use. It's no
[3DStudio](http://www.autodesk.com/3dsmax) but it'll do in a pinch. Plus
you can then place your 3D model on [Google
Earth](http://earth.google.com/) so you can see what it will look like
out in the world. Cool!
