Today is my birthday, so happy birthday to me! I've reached 28 which, as
far as ages go, is neither here nor there. Not a bad place to be, mind
you.

 Woke up this morning ([got yourself a
gun](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003A9MG/mhsvortex)?)
around 6:00 because, while I have the day off, Jenn works. I got my
presents from her (I like presents): [*The Best of James
Taylor*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007IT8S/mhsvortex)
and a [Harry Potter Lego
set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001A86AU/mhsvortex). Very
cool.

 Jenn's working a half day, and when she gets home we're going to head
up to Seattle to visit family and do the tourist thing. I'm in the
process of ripping the James Taylor album so we can listen to it on the
iPod on the way up.

 Aside from that, no real insight. Another year older and wiser, as they
say. A lot's happened, though (most of which I'm remembering from
scanning through my site... it's a good thing I keep this thing or I'd
never remember anything). Let's see...

 Not bad for a year. I look forward to what's in store for me this year.
Stick around, folks. I think it's gonna be a good one.
