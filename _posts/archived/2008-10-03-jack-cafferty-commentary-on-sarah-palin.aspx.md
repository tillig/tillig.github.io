I don't generally get into politics, and I can't remember really ever
posting anything political here, but I have to put this up because it
is, by far, my favorite political commentary ever. It's a clip of Jack
Cafferty, a political analyst for CNN, talking about Sarah Palin's
interview with Katie Couric.

It's like Saturday Night Live, only real life. I've watched this like 10
times now and I fall down laughing every time. It's all about Cafferty's
deadpan delivery. I think I'm gonna go watch this again.
