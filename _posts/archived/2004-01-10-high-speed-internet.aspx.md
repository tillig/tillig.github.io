I'm rocking with the high speed Internet now, baby! Went down to the
[Comcast](http://www.comcast.com) office and picked myself up a cable
modem and driver kit, and now things move faster than fast. More human
than human, friends.
 
 I'm anticipating this will have a positive effect on my desire to do
computer-related things at home (like update the blog, etc.) but will
probably be not so great for my social skills.
 
 At least [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com) won't
take all night anymore.
