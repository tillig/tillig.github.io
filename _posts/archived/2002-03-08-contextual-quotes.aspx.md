Comedian [Lewis Black](http://www.lewisblack.net/) has a good bit he
does about how certain phrases people say in their conversation stick
out, sort of like someone saying your name really loud in a crowded
room, so that your mind grabs hold of them and ponders them out of
context.

 I think the phrase Black overhears (while sitting in the local IHOP) is
*"If it weren't for my horse, I wouldn't have spent that year in
college."*

 Huh?

 Right. So I was thinking about some of the conversations I've had
recently, and I realized that a lot of the stuff I (or, more directly,
the people I'm talking to) say is extremely context-sensitive. My
favorites as of late: *"Holy shit, Suze! I was just on fire!"* (Which
was followed closely thereafter with *"And then, after I put myself
out..."*)

 Anyway.

 I just got a call from the auto body shop. My car is fixed! That's a
really good thing, since that means I don't have to drive [The
Babemobile](/archive/2002/03/07/the-babemobile.aspx) all weekend.
