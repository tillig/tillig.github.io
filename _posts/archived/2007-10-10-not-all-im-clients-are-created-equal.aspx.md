I've used several instant messaging clients up to now, but I'm recently
getting some experience with [Lotus
Sametime](http://www.ibm.com/lotus/sametime).  Somehow it feels like
someone on the product side over there thought, "Hey, if we bill this as
an 'Enterprise' client, we can ignore any UI goodness whatsoever!  It
doesn't have to look good because it's 'Enterprise!'"

I think they should rename it "Lotus VB6time" because, well... see for
yourself.

VB6!]({{ site.url }}/images/20071010vb6time.png)

I can see the sales droid selling this now, invoking adjectives like
"minimalist" and "rugged."  It doesn't matter what it looks like as long
as it works, right?  Right?
