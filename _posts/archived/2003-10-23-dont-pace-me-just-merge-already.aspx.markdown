I couldn't take a picture of today's Traffic Asshole of the Week because
it's foggy out and all you really would have gotten to see with my
shitty camera is fog with two taillights in it. Not too interesting.

 Since there's no visual accompaniment, I'll make it brief.

 Cruising along the freeway today - again, admittedly foggy - going
about 60mph. I was one exit before I needed to get off the freeway and
was driving alongside the freeway onramp.

 As the person already on the freeway, it's my job to maintain speed and
constancy so the guy on the ramp can adjust accordingly and properly
merge. I had a three-second following distance behind the guy in front
of me, and there was quite a bit of space behind me. The guy merging had
plenty of space.

 Did he take it? Hell, no.

 He decided it would be a good idea to pace me - match speed and
position so he'd eventually merge right into my side. I started getting
worried because he was running out of room, so I sped up, at which point
he decided it was a race and also sped up.

 Hey, my exit was next, so I decided to slow down and let him in. I
mean, who cares, right?

 This guy merging saw that and then decided to slow down, too, so that
he was *again* pacing me speed-wise, but now his rear bumper was going
to merge into my front fender.

 Time to lay on the horn.

 You know what? The guy just continued to merge.

 He slowed me down to 45mph, merging ever closer to my front bumper. I
couldn't get around him because of the solid line of cars in the other
lane.

 He then stayed at 45 - 15 mph less than the rest of traffic - all the
way to my exit. As I exited, he merged into the *fast lane*, still going
45.

 What an asshole.
