Watching TV last night, saw a commercial for a current popular movie.
The opening line of the commercial killed me. Imagine, in that deep
announcer's voice, you hear:

 "Only one movie in America is number one this week!"

 As opposed to *what*? Like, two movies *tied* for number one? That's
brilliant. I think [the writers from Kettle
Chips](/archive/2004/05/19/kettle-chips-hiring.aspx) must have moved
down to California.
