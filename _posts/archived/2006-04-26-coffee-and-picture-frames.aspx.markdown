I ordered a copy of [*Tomb Raider:
Legend*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0XSN6/mhsvortex) a
while ago and it came in the mail last night. It also came with a
lithograph (reads: picture printed on cardstock) of the image from the
cover of the box, which is pretty cool.

 While Jenn and I were out last night I picked up the "el cheapo" frame
at Jo-Ann for $2 so I could put it up in my cube and have something to
hang it by (I'm not a big fan of poking holes in my pictures, so the
frame basically serves as a picture hanging device).

 I got it all the way to work and started getting out of the car with it
this morning when I realized my hands were pretty full - coffee,
computer bag, name badge, picture... Should I put something down or make
a couple of trips? Nah...

 ...at which point my coffee decided to spill out the travel mug and all
over the picture.

 I'm not sure if you've ever had coffee *inside* a picture frame (like
between the picture and the glass), but that's a bitch to clean up.
Sticky, greasy... ugh. Nightmare.

 Everything came out fine in the end (no big deal if it hadn't, but it's
nice when there's no loss). Maybe next time I'll put stuff down or make
two trips.

 Or maybe I'll just keep on doin' what I'm doin' and screw it up again.
Which is more likely?
