Of course, I see a lot of weird, funny, and (sometimes) disturbing stuff
out there on the 'net, but [WTF People](http://www.wtfpeople.com/) has
it all. Not all of it is that messed up; some of it is [really
funny](http://www.drparsons.fsnet.co.uk/georg.html). Give it a look. But
not at work, if you get, like, tracked and stuff. :)
