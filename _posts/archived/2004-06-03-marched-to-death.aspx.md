Release 1 of the death-march project I was working on was completed
yesterday, so now I'm taking a little time to recoup and finally put
things away in my cubicle since the move (right in the middle of that
project, everyone in my department shifted cubicles around and I
basically chucked all of my stuff in boxes and kept working... up until
yesterday it was all a huge chaotic mess).

 This coming Monday is the project post-mortem, so we'll go over the
things that worked, the things that didn't work, and decide where we
want to go from here. There's still a lot to do on that project, so I
don't anticipate I've seen the end of it. That said, I feel a sick sort
of ownership for it now that I've spent all this hard time with it. It'd
be a little difficult to just give it away cold turkey; I'd like to see
it grow. (I just don't want to spend what's left of my sanity and
patience on it, is all. If we can come up with a *reasonable schedule*
and some *reasonable expectations*, I'm all over it. That'll never
happen, though, so I'm in a quandary.)

 I'm studying for my last Micrososft certification exam now, which will
make me a Microsoft Certified Database Administrator. Then I'll have
both my "Solutions Developer" and "Database Admin" certifications, and I
think I'll call it good. It's been a long road to get here and I'm glad
to be close to the end of it. You're supposed to "renew" your
certifications whenever new versions of the products come out... I don't
know. I mean, I like to keep current and all, but it's a lot of work to
get a piece of paper, and studying for tests is nothing like actually
doing the work on a day to day basis. Nothing substitutes for
experience.

 Seems that lots of folks are excited for the [next installation of
*Harry Potter*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/), including Jenn,
who says we're definitely seeing it this weekend. I dunno. I've loved
the last two, but I need to maintain a clean slate when it comes to
being excited and/or having expectations for movies. All too often I go
in expecting a great show and it turns out to be just "pretty good." We
shall see.
