Catching up on the morning news and whatnot I came across two different
and interesting issues.
 
 The first is a new KB article over at Microsoft: [*How and Why Session
IDs are Reused in
ASP.NET*](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;899918).
Describes how the session ID is reused across applications on a server
but the session instance is local to the application. Also describes
what to do if you don't want to reuse the session ID for your
application.
 
 The second issue is something I ran across this weekend. I was using a
calculator program and one of the operations I entered (in the series)
was 5.35 - 5.45. The answer I got back was -0.100000000000001: just a
bit off from what I was expecting. I tried it again, and the same answer
came back.
 
 I ended up contacting the author of the program and he uses the Windows
Script Host to perform calculations, so I wrote a quick test VBScript:
 
    Dim myvar
    myvar = 5.35 - 5.45
    WScript.Echo myvar


 Turns out the answer is still -0.100000000000001. I did a quick search
on this and [Eric Lippert explains why it's
happening](http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/09/15/53000.aspx).
Long story short - rounding errors due to the base 2 nature of the
computer. I understand the answer, but I'm not sure I like it. Makes me
wonder if computers shouldn't have been base 10 to begin with. Heh.
