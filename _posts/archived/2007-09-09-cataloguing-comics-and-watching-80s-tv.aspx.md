This weekend hasn't been terribly eventful.  Yesterday most of the day
was spent either doing chores around the house or watching [*Prison
Break* Season
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RO6JY0?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000RO6JY0).

Today, Jenn has so far spent at least four hours playing
[*Bioshock*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MKA60W?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000MKA60W) and
during that time I've been watching
*[Voyagers!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PFUAN2?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000PFUAN2)*
and cataloguing comic books on
[ComicsPriceGuide.com](http://www.comicspriceguide.com).  There's
something strangely relaxing about watching nostalgic TV on DVD and
playing the obsessive-compulsive collector.  The tedium of entering the
comics in the site, bagging and boarding them... it borders between a
lame chore and the work of personal pride.

My cat is exceptionally loyal, following me from room to room as I
gather supplies and taking up residence in the papasan chair in the
corner while I dutifully enter comics on the site.

I think this is what Sundays are meant for.
