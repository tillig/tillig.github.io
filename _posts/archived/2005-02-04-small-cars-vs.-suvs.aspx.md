I'm not a big fan of the SUV. Between the fact that most of the people
who own them never go offroad, never haul anything, and don't know how
to drive and/or park them, and the fact that they consume natural
resources like they're going out of style, I believe the SUV is the
largest atrocity ever to saunter slowly down the freeway.

 To that end, here's an excellent educational article for you: [Are
