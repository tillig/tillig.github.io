Record year this year despite Halloween being on a weekday. The weather
was pretty nice, which I'm guessing made it more amenable to be out, but
otherwise I'm not sure why we got such a boost. We even shut down half
an hour early - at 8:00p instead of 8:30p - to get Phoenix to bed. (We
had a couple of kids knock after we shut the lights off, so you see
those in that final time block.)

The costume this year was a BioShock splicer.

Jenn didn't get her costume done, but is working on a splicer costume
for the Halloween party we're attending this weekend. Phoenix was, at
various points, a fairy; a princess; and Merida from *Brave*.

People in general were much more pleasant this year, but it probably
helped that Phoenix was the one handing out the candy most of the time.
It's hard to be pissed off with a two year old fairy putting candy in
your bag. Even the older kids who are usually sort of belligerent got
really friendly. Plus, Phoe had a great time with it and talked to all
of them like they were best friends.

This was also Phoe's first trick-or-treat year. She went to Jenn's work,
my mom's work, and my work; and she also ran up and down our block.
There's more candy at our house than we know what to do with, and she
had a total blast.
