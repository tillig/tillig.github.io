I was sitting, bored, waiting to get into [*The Italian
Job*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0317740), when I thought of some names
for bands that I haven't heard *yet* (but anticipate hearing about soon,
I'm sure):

- Metalfinger
- Swagger
- Big Boy Pants
- Drama Queen
- Slackinator

Plus, I've always thought that if I were to have a band, it would
probably be called "The Industrial Consortium." Any other good band
names out there?
