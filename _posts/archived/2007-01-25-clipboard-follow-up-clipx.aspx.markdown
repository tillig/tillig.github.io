After [posting about several clipboard management software packages I'd
tried](/archive/2007/01/24/clipboard-manager-software.aspx) that didn't
quite meet my needs, I got some great comments from readers and tried
out a few suggested packages.
 
 I finally ended up with [ClipX](http://bluemars.org/clipx/) - it does
everything I was hoping for.
-   You can right-click on the tray icon and select a clip, making it
    the active clip on the clipboard but not automatically pasting
    anything into any application.
-   You can use an alternate "paste" key to have the menu of clips pop
    up right in the application you're working in and select the clip to
    make active and paste - no confusing out-of-application experience.
-   The interface is minimal - there's no giant explorer window to deal
    with. The biggest it gets is the "clip management" window that lists
    out the current set of clips and lets you edit or delete them, but
    even that is basically just a big listbox.
-   It's got a plugin SDK and a few interesting plugins ready for
    download.
-   There are configuration options, but not so many it's overwhelming
    and every one of them makes sense.


 Installed and loving it so far.
 
 Here's the interface working inline - hit the "alternate paste" key (by
default Ctrl-Shift-V) to bring this up and select a clip to paste in...

 And here's the tray menu where you can just select the clip to make
active without actually having to paste anything...

 I'm digging it. [Check it out.](http://bluemars.org/clipx/)
