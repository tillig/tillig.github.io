I've been so busy lately, I totally spaced writing up the weekend. It
was nice and we did our best to relax, so we intentionally didn't do too
much. As such, I'll try to keep it short.
 
 Friday night we went out with some friends of ours, Jason, Tracy, and
Adam, and had some Mexican food for dinner. After that, we went back to
their place and, totally trashed, proceeded to *kick their sorry asses*
at [*Scene
It*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A9Y4I/mhsvortex). I am
the *KING*.
 
 Saturday there was a lot of sleeping. I've been pretty stressed out
lately and Saturday I think it caught up with me. I got up late and
didn't do a whole lot. Oh, that's right - Jenn and I got a copy of
[*Halo 2*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008J7NZ/mhsvortex)
and we're playing through cooperatively so she can get her skills up to
speed and put the smack down on my dad next time we're all playing
online.
 
 Sunday we went to Fry's and I bought [*Burnout
Revenge*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009WPZMW/mhsvortex)
and [*The
Outfit*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BLNFPA/mhsvortex).
Both were totally on sale, so I got a pretty good deal. Brought them
home, and both are good fun. Entertainment budget well spent.
 
 Monday we took a gaming break and just hung out. We ended up heading to
the movies and saw [*X-Men 3*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0376994/), and
I thought it was at least as good as the second one, if not better. I
recommend it, and didn't feel cheated paying full evening price for it.
 
 That's about it. Got back to work Tuesday, just that much further
behind, and now I'm crawling my way through the week, trying not to let
The Man get me down, so to speak. We're moving at quite the breakneck
pace trying to get things done, though, and I'm feeling pretty damn
burned out. Vacation doesn't help, either. Something's gotta give.
