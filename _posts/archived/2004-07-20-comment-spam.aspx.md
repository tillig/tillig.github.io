I have finally been deemed popular enough to receive stupid blog comment
spam. I've gotten probably five or six in the last week. I turned up the
amount of time required between comment posts, so at least I don't get
totally hammered, but other than that, I'm hosed unless someone's got a
pMachine Free plugin that uses captcha images... or I enable
registration for commenting, which wouldn't be too bad, seeing as how no
legitimate readers ever comment on stuff around here anyway. Heh.
