I hadn't seen [the first season of
*24*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLF2/mhsvortex), so
this past Saturday my dad brought it over,
[Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) showed up, and we had
[another](/archive/2004/10/11/24-in-less-than-20.aspx)
[*24*](/archive/2004/12/29/24-season-3-anchorman-resident-evil-apocalypse.aspx)
[marathon](/archive/2005/12/24/24-season-4.aspx).

 Once again, well worth the time spent. I can see totally why the show
took off. Great cast, great writing... it doesn't get much better.

 It also showed me how they reward long-time viewers: if you watch
carefully, you can see peripheral characters from previous seasons show
up in later seasons with larger parts, tying things in together nicely.

 My dad ended up loaning Stu the second season so he can catch up, which
is cool. [That's where I
started.](/archive/2004/10/11/24-in-less-than-20.aspx) Stu also
apparently had the weird *24* surreal after-effect I had after my first
marathon where he just *had to call Jack and tell him about the bomb on
the plane* at 3:00a. Funny, but understandable. Heh.

 Dad says the fifth season is the best yet, so I'm excited for this fall
when it comes out on DVD.
