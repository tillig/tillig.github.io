Something I meant to write about last week - a word of warning to the
snack lovers out there:

 *If you eat a sufficient number of
[Guacachips](http://www.costplus.com/costplus/showindpublicproduct?cat=wine&productid=1203),
your poop will be just shy of lime green.*

 "The dip's in the chip," *indeed*.
