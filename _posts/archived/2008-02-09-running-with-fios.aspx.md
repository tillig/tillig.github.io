The [Verizon Fios](http://www.verizon.com/fios) installers just left,
and I've got my 15mbps up/2mpbs down running in full form. Got
everything transferred over to use the Verizon router and Xbox Live, my
primary network problem child, seems to be working swimmingly.

Of course, it didn't come off without a hitch - the person taking our
order mistyped the phone number, so the installers couldn't really
transfer our phone number from Comcast to Verizon because the paperwork
didn't match. So now we have Verizon video and data, and we have both
Verizon and Comcast phone. How does that work? Verizon is actually
hooked up and running but with the wrong phone number. We've had to
temporarily keep the Comcast voice service, even if no Comcast junk is
hooked up, so we don't lose our number. It will take a week of futzing
around through annoying phone trees and fighting with service people who
can't get off the standard script in order for us to get the number
switched. A week to do a two minute job.

Oh, Verizon. I knew you had horrible customer service, and so far, well,
I wasn't wrong.

I like the menus and the TV features a lot better than the Comcast
stuff. The UI is far slicker and has a lot of little helpful things in
it than the Comcast one did. The net connection seems pretty nice, too,
but I can't really speak to it much since I've only written this blog
entry and gotten things basically connected. We'll see how she goes
soon.

Oh, and it's like $50/month cheaper, which doesn't hurt.
