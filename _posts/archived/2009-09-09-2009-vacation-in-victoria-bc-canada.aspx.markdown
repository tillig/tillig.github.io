It was time to take another vacation, so this time Jenn and I set our
sights on a non-Vegas destination: Victoria, British Columbia. We headed
out August 24 - 27.

We left Monday morning for Port Angeles, WA, and took the ferry over to
Victoria. We stayed at [The Hotel Grand
Pacific](http://www.hotelgrandpacific.com), conveniently on the same
block as the ferry.

Monday night we really didn't do anything but wander around a bit and
have dinner. Dinner, though, is where I discovered [Phillips Longboat
Double Chocolate Porter](http://www.phillipsbeer.com/). Now, I'm really
not a "beer guy," but this was *tasty stuff*. (I ended up tracking down
the brewery, which is right downtown Victoria, and getting a case to
bring home.)

Tuesday we visited [The Butchart
Gardens](http://www.butchartgardens.com). It was pretty amazing, all the
different kinds of flowers and gardens they have. Glad I took my allergy
pills!

After the gardens we went to the top on Mt. Douglas and checked out the
view. Definitely something to see, but harder to get to than you might
think. Try as we might, we just could not stick on the roads shown on
the map. We had quite the adventure getting to Mt. Douglas and saw most
of Victoria in the process.

Wednesday we took a tour of [the BC Parliament
Building](http://www.leg.bc.ca/) and learned a bit about the government
there. While the architecture was interesting, the best part was going
to the visitor gallery and watching parliament in session. There was an
argument going on about a proposed new tax system and it was very
heated. Way better than [C-Span](http://www.c-span.org/).

Thursday morning we had to leave, but before we did we went out to the
front of [the hotel](http://www.hotelgrandpacific.com) and watched them
feed the ducks. Apparently they have these ducks that come back year
after year to swim in the fountain out front and get fed by the
maintenance guy each morning. At one point they had close to 60 ducks!
We only saw about 30, but it was pretty crazy.

In all, a good trip. Left a few things (like [the Royal BC
Museum](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca)) to see on future trips, but saw
a lot and had a good time.
