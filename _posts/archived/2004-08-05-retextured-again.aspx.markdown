The drywall contractors returned yesterday and [patched my drywall
again](/archive/2004/08/02/i-wont-be-beaten-by-drywall.aspx).
Unbelieveable. It's done, though, so now I'm going to wait until the
weekend to paint it. Assuming all goes according to plan, we might even
be able to finish that bathroom this weekend (minus the crown molding we
wanted to put up) and start on the other bathroom we had planned to
paint. We already have the paint, we just need to start. I didn't want
to start a new project until this one was finished.
 
 With any luck...
