The TV repair shop just called me and they say they've been playing the
set for four days now and haven't seen the problems I've been talking
about. No distortions, no color changes, no nothing.

 *They can't reproduce that shit?*

 Unbelievable. I told them precisely what to check (solid colors on the
screen, straight lines like the bars that show up in widescreen mode,
etc.) - and how I illustrated it to the guy who came to my house - and
they're going to ensure the tech who's working on the set has checked
all that. I also mentioned that we used to live in the same area as the
TV repair shop and if the North Pole plays a factor in this thing,
that's going to be less of an issue in the same geographic region.

 If they can't reproduce it, I'm going down there to see with my own
eyes that the problem isn't there.

 If it turns out it really isn't there when it's in the shop... well, it
looks like I'm screwed. They will claim it's "environmental" (sure it is

- the North Pole is environmental) and they can't reproduce it, at which
point I have to fight with the National Electronics Warranty company to
get them to replace the tube, which, I'm told, rarely happens for
environmental issues.

 So I'd have to get a new TV, which I'm not anxious to do. Or try moving
this TV into a different room, which really isn't going to work. Or try
changing things around in that same room to guess and see if I can
figure out what's going on.

 If the guy calls me tomorrow, they're sending the TV back to me next
Tuesday. If he doesn't, then they're checking into it some more.

 Let's hope he doesn't call me.
