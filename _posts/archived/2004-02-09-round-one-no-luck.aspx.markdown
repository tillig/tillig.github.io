Jenn and I spent five or six hours driving around to between 10 and 12
different houses on Saturday with our realtor and the best we got was a
house that we *wouldn't have minded* living in, but nothing that called
to us.

 We found one listing that we totally fell in love with, but when we got
to the address it turned out someone had listed the wrong picture with
the address. We were beyond disappointed, because that was *the house*.
That really sucked. I mean, it was located right by the local *landfill*
and I was still sold. Our realtor is going to contact the person who
listed the article and see where that house actually is.

 I had hoped this wouldn't be a three-month process the way several
people had told me it would be, but I guess that's just how it is.

 I did get the paperwork from my mortgage broker in the mail on
Saturday, though, and now that it's all signed and off to her, we can be
a little more serious about having money and getting this house thing
done. Not that I wasn't serious before, mind you, but now I've actually
*signed stuff*. That makes it all official-like.
