I took a couple of pictures over the last few days I thought might share
with you folks. This being my first foray into photojournalism, don't
expect much.

 First, I took a picture of the extraordinarily meager drink selection
that they offered at the training facility I attended the last few days.
There were a couple of cans of orange and grape flavored pop, too, but
those went quick.

 And second, I came home a couple of days ago and found that our
16-pound cat had decided to make herself at home in the middle of the
coffee table.

 That cat may be a girl, but she's got a solid set of balls on her.
 Here's another angle so you can see how truly huge she is.
