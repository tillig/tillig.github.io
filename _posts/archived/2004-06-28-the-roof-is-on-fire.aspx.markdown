Jenn and I had the housewarming on Saturday. Started that up about 4:00p
(we figured a nice afternoon/evening barbecue, get together hang out,
wrap it up around 8 or so...) and closed the place down at a little
after midnight when the last guests of the evening - *Jenn's parents[i]
took off.

 We had about 30 people show up, and after tallying up who invited who,
it turned out there were slightly more of Jenn's friends than mine.
Hmmm. Interesting, considering I put the invite out to a [i]lot* of my
friends.

 Of the folks invited, three who RSVP'd that they'd be there didn't show
and one of the "maybe" responses showed (actually, two, but the second
one didn't show up until *the next day* because he got the date wrong).

 What I really found interesting was that [only
one](http://www.greghughes.net) of the guys from my work showed up. That
was a little disappointing. Considering I spend the majority of my
waking hours hanging out with these guys, I would have hoped more would
show. That's okay; it sort of indicates why Jenn and I generally don't
have parties.

 The folks who did show, though, were awesome, and it was great to see
each and every one of them. To the people who brought gifts, *thank you
very much*. We already spent all but $0.68 of the Home Depot gift cards
we got, and I'm drinking a [very tasty cup of
coffee](http://www.senseo.com/) this morning.

 All in all, it was a blast. We barbecued (and still have more
hamburgers and hot dogs than we know what to do with), we talked, we
spilled drinks all over my hardwood floors (hehehe... at least it was
the hardwoods and not the carpets, right?), we got a little loud and we
generally had a great time.

 Interesting social note: It was a little like a high school dance - all
of my friends on one side of the house and all of Jenn's friends on the
other. I think the next party - if there is one - will probably be just
one of those two groups. It's hard to go back and forth between the two,
since I feel a little like a poor host when I do: not quite paying
attention to anyone there because I'm too busy floating around.
