It never bodes well when you go up to the next floor and an aroma
somewhere between popcorn and Trix comes wafting from the break room and
descends upon your very soul. It is times like these when you know that
making a hasty retreat is a moral imperative, regardless of your reason
for venturing beyond your own veal pen.
 
 Friday, and paid time-off, rapidly approaches. I'm taking Friday and
Monday off to attempt some rest and relaxation of sorts, although I will
be spending some of that time with extended family in Seattle so who
knows what brands of hell might break loose while that's going on. It's
always a good time visiting them, though, so I do look forward to it.
I'm hoping my cousin Adam will bust out some of his increasingly-famous
lewd dance maneuvers. That always livens the party up some, much to the
chagrin of his mother.
 
 I finally got a drywall contractor to come in and give me a bid on [my
bathroom job](/archive/2004/07/02/wall-decals.aspx), which I promptly
accepted since he was the only one I could actually get to show up,
albeit 45 minutes late. Now I just need the job *started*.
 
 I also took my car because the "check engine" light came on [a couple
days ago](/archive/2004/07/16/im-stressed-out-man.aspx) and got that
back with no significant issues. They had to do some sort of
reprogramming with the onboard computer... something to do with the idle
timing. Whatever. It fell under warranty and, as always, the service was
excellent, so I'm not sweating it.
 
 Thus, I am regaining composure, slowly yet surely closing on issues,
and looking forward to a long weekend. (I had to take some vacation soon
anyway because I was rapidly approaching the "use-it-or-lose-it" point.
Regardless of the reason, vacation is vacation, which is to say, "not
being at work," so it must be a Good Thing. Right?)
