Well, I can't say I'm terribly surprised by the outcome of last night's
[*American Idol*](http://idolonfox.msn.com) show.
[Nikki's](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/nicky_ozmet/default.asp)
been voted out of the competition. I say I'm not surprised because she
was *so* outclassed vocally by the two other contestants that if it
hadn't happened, I'd wonder what was wrong with America.
 
 So Nikki's gone, but not forgotten. I hope she continues to pursue her
career, because I'd buy a Nikki McKibbin album. She has that rocker edge
to her that makes her entertaining.
 
 I still hope
[Kelly](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/kelly_clarkson/default.asp)
wins, though.
[Justin's](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/justin_guarini/default.asp)
good, but I like Kelly better.
 
 I am glad that we got to hear Nikki sing [Stevie Nicks's *Edge of
Seventeen*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002JO6/mhsvortex).
I think that was a great song for her. It doesn't hurt that I like that
song a lot, either.
 
 Speaking of *Edge of Seventeen* and songs I like... I was listening to
[Mark and Brian](http://www.markandbrian.com) the other morning and
after they played whatever bumper music they were playing, Brian said
something about that bumper music being "the perfect song." I don't
remember what the song was, but the idea of "the perfect song" stuck in
my head. I don't think there is any *one* "perfect song," but there are
certain songs I feel are "perfect." *Edge of Seventeen* is one of those.
I'm not even sure really *why*. Maybe it's the little background guitar
riff thing going on. Maybe it's the harmony. Maybe it's just Stevie. Who
knows. But it's one of those songs that sounds better the louder you
play it, and you can listen to it over and over without really getting
tired of it. Sometimes I wish there were like 20 minute long mixes of
some of these "perfect songs."
 
 What else would I consider a "perfect song?" Let's see... a list of
some of them (that I thought up in the car this morning) include:
 
-   [Stevie Nicks: *Edge of
    Seventeen*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002JO6/mhsvortex)
-   [Any Fleetwood Mac song featuring Christine McVie (i.e., *Little
    Lies*)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LFZ/mhsvortex)
-   [The Weather Girls: *It's Raining
    Men*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005J6SN/mhsvortex)
-   [Robert Miles:
    *Fable*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002VRQ/mhsvortex)
-   [Sarah Brightman: *Deliver
    Me*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000IL1K/mhsvortex)


 
 There are lots of others, I just happen to think of these today.
 
 I read somewhere (or maybe I heard it?) that music is completely
mathematically related. The vibrations of the strings on the instruments
and the meter the song is carried out in, etc. I wonder what the
mathematic commonalities between the songs are? If someone could figure
that out, it would follow that you could potentially reverse-engineer
what makes a "perfect song" and come up with a mathematical formula that
you could plug a couple of numbers into and generate a "perfect song"
every time. Would that take the artistry out of the song, or would the
generation of the song itself be the art?
