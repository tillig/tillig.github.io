Went to see *[Cloverfield](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/)* this
weekend.

What I expected: A cool, maybe kinda scary, fun roller-coaster-ride
monster movie.

What I got: A headache from too much shaky-cam following stupid people
through New York.

Before I get a bunch of people telling me I missed the point, let me
stem the tide: I got it. I mean, I get the whole "point of view" thing
and how the interesting bit was that rather than tell the monster movie
story from an omniscient perspective they drilled down and got it from a
'new and different" perspectiveÂ - that of victims. I get it.

That doesn't make it good.

Really, I think the shaky-cam thing got old. Let's ignore the "but
that's the point" argument. I've never seen home movies as ridiculously
shaky as what they showed. Even the stuff at the beginning, when they
weren't being chased by the monster, was shakier than any home movie
I've ever seen. By the end of the movie, Jenn couldn't even watch it -
she had to close her eyes and just listen because it was far, far more
jarring than even *[Blair Witch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/)*
(which also sucked).

Oh, and if you're being chased by a giant monster and buildings are
falling all around you and you happen to drop the camera, are you going
to go back and pick it up? Further, are you going to run around with it
at eye level the whole time? Hell, no. You're going to throw the camera
at the monster chasing you and you're going to high-tail it out of
there.

Did I mention the thing pretty much just ended, without any resolution
to what happened to the monster? Did it die? Did it live? We don't know.

There were really only three parts I dug about it (and, technically,
these are spoilers, but you're going to be smart and save your money,
right?):

1.  The part where the stealth bombers show up to lay waste on the
    monster.
2.  The part where the girl explodes after getting bitten.
3.  The fact that little mini-creatures get dropped off the one big
    creature. That shit creeped me out.

Other than that, lame, lame, lame. I wanted less of the morons running
around the city and more of the military getting medieval on the
monster. I wanted less shaky cam and more ability to actually see what
was going on.

Save your money. Or, better, go see
*[Juno](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/)*. *That* movie was great.
