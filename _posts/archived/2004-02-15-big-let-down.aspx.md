Jenn and I drove around yesterday and weeded out the neighborhoods and
houses that we didn't like, and today we went out with our realtor's
partner, Terri, to look at the remaining properties on our "list."
(Gregory, the realtor, is on vacation in Mexico. I'd like to be on
vacation, too.)

 As it turns out, we had like nine different places on the list to look
at, but yesterday we weeded them down to four, and today we found out
that two of them are pending sale, so that left two. Which was okay,
since we found one house that we were really excited about from looking
at the pictures and that one was still available.

 We went in that one and I was, to say the least, *underwhelmed*. I'm
not sure if I had built up my expectations too much or if it really just
wasn't the house for us, but we were really disappointed once we got
inside.

 We didn't even look in the second house - turns out it's right next to
some train tracks, and I'm *so* not into dealing with that.

 Which means the search continues. I've heard that it takes a while,
but, man, that one house really had me hoping we could cut this short.

 In the meantime, I've noticed that limiting my budget (and, thus, my
monthly payments) as much as I have has also limited the number of
properties that I've seen that fit my space requirements. While I at
first thought 1500 square feet would be enough, I find that those are
barely larger than our current apartment of 1100 square feet, and with
the layouts they have, they generally feel smaller. My new goal is
closer to the 2000 square foot range, which means I've gotta up my
spending limit. It may be harder in the first couple of years we're
there, but we'll manage somehow. If it's somewhere we can live for
several years, I think it'll be worth it.
