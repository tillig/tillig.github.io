The new version has been released which allows you to provide an
optional delimiter parameter for your Join Lines keyboard shortcuts that
inserts the provided string between each joined line. Great for joining
separate lines into comma-separated lists or providing a space as a
delimiter when cleaning up XML elements whose attributes span several
lines.
