Got home yesterday and noticed that the
[Roomba](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022HYJ6/mhsvortex),
which is normally parked on its [Home
Base](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00022HZ0O/mhsvortex)
charging, was parked... but not charging.
 
 The Home Base has two lights - one light is for "power" (that is, power
to the Home Base) and one is "charging" (which lights up when the Roomba
is charging itself). The "power" light was flashing and the "charging"
light wasn't on.
 
 Tried docking it a couple of times but Roomba doesn't recognize the
Home Base as a valid source of energy anymore. Tried plugging Roomba in
directly, but Roomba's own charging light sort of flickers rather than
staying on strong.
 
 I think there's something wrong with the power adapter. That's the only
thing I can think of. I filed a help question with the [iRobot support
people](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=133) and we'll see how that
goes. I don't want to buy another power brick. Those damn things are
like \$50.
 
 After futzing with the Roomba, I went in to see what Jenn was up to.
She was watching television, but for some reason had the VCR on... huh?
 
 Oh, I see - that's because the digital cable box died. Great. The
display on it goes black then flashes "88:88" and goes black again. No
signal coming through. Unreal.
 
 I'd blame a power surge, but the cable box was plugged into a surge
protector and no other components plugged into that protector were
affected (thank God - my TV's on that one). Maybe just a bad electronic
coincidence. Regardless, Jenn will take the cable box in and get it
swapped for a new one, and I'll have to wait and see what iRobot says
about the power adapter.
