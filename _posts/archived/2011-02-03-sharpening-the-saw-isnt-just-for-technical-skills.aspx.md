There have been a lot of developer-related "[sharpening the
saw](https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php)" articles
published and almost all of them speak to the technical aspect of
becoming a better developer. A couple of popular ones
([Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SharpenTheSawForDevelopers.aspx),
[Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html))
have some suggestions like having technical brown-bags or reading
programming blogs. These are wonderful suggestions for improving your
technical abilities as a developer.

However, if you look at [the actual description of "sharpening the
saw,"](https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php)
originally from Steven Covey's [*7 Habits of Highly Effective
People*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743269519?tag=mhsvortex), it talks
about having a "balanced program for self-renewal." If all you do as a
developer is focus on increasing your technical skills, you're not
really keeping in balance.

Perhaps it's time to broaden your thoughts on what it means, as a
developer, to "sharpen the saw." What can you do to increase your
skills/value that doesn't involve technical abilities? Here are some
ideas:

- **Take a writing course.** Your local higher-education facilities
    (and many correspondence schools) most likely offer courses in basic
    writing. Not writing code, just writing. Prose. Why is that
    important? Most likely you aren't writing just code all day. Whether
    it's email, design documentation, blog posts, or other
    communications, you're writing. **If you want to be sure to be
    understood and if you want your communications to come across in a
    reasonably professional and proficient fashion, you need to be able
    to write in a cohesive fashion** with a minimal amount of
    grammatical problems. This is not to say you need to become a
    novelist or write for *The New Yorker*, but especially in this
    social networking day-and-age where spelling and grammar are pitched
    out the window in favor of shortcuts and 140-character limits,
    having a good set of solid, basic writing skills will help you
    long-term.
- **Learn about UI design and user experience.** It's pretty well
    known that developers generally create some pretty horrible UI out
    of the box. It's not because developers are incompetent, but because
    when they're crafting that UI they're not thinking about design
    principles or the user experience of the thing. Like UI is best left
    to "those folks on the other side of the office with those fancy
    turtlenecks and their copies of Photoshop." Just as developers need
    to understand testing and not defer to QA, it's valuable for
    developers to understand at least fundamental ideas of UI design and
    user experience. At the very least, **this will allow you to take
    part in conversations about the UI in a more meaningful fashion**
    and understand not just *what* you're doing when the UX team asks
    you to fix something, but also *why you're doing it*.
- **Take a class on being a mentor.** [Hanselman mentions in his
    post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SharpenTheSawForDevelopers.aspx)
    that one idea to help sharpen technical skills is to create a
    mentorship program. That's a really good idea. But do you know how
    to be a mentor? Do you need a mentor on how to be a mentor? What
    does "mentoring" even mean? If you have a mentor to help you learn
    new things, do you know *how to be mentored*? It sounds like it's a
    simple thing, but think about it: Has someone ever asked you a
    question, and when you answered it you knew they didn't understand
    the answer but you also didn't know how to give them an answer they
    would understand? Learning how to answer questions (as a mentor) and
    learning how to ask the right questions (as a mentee) is *huge*.
    I've taken [the Practical Leader class on peer
    mentoring](http://www.peermentoring.com/) and I honestly can't
    recommend it enough. It's one of the best courses I've ever taken
    and it totally changed the way I approach helping and teaching
    people.
- **Improve your interpersonal communication skills.** If you've
    worked in any sort of team, you'll have run into a situation where
    there was a confrontation between two team members that probably
    could have been handled better. In coding, for example, sometimes
    ego gets in the way of what's best for the code. Maybe someone on
    the team has a strong personality and you don't know how to make
    suggestions to them. Maybe someone on the team has a milder
    personality and you don't know how to coax their input/feedback from
    them when trying to make decisions. Whatever the case may be,
    **strengthening your communications skills will help you work better
    in the team**. One course I've taken and highly recommend is the
    [Vital Smarts "Crucial Conversations"
    training](http://www.vitalsmarts.com/crucialconversations_book.aspx).
    It's one of those classes where, as you're going through it, it
    feels like it's revealing information to you that you already knew
    but didn't consciously recognize. Suddenly, being conscious of it,
    you realize all the things you did wrong in previous poor
    interactions, how things could have been handled better... and how
    you'll approach things next time you encounter the situation. Well
    worth the time.

Again, the idea here is that **there are things other than technical
skills that will help you sharpen your saw** as a developer.

**What do you do in a non-technical capacity to sharpen your saw?**
