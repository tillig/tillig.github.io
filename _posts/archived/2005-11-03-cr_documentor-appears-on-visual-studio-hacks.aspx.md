The [Visual Studio Hacks](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/) site just
published an article in their new "Ask The Pros" series called "[Ask The
Pros: Visual Studio .NET
Addins.](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/atpAddins)" In that article,
[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) gave some props to
[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
as his favorite DXCore plugin. Thanks, Scott!
