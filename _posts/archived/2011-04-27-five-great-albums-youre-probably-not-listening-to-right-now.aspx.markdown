While I'm on a recommendation kick, I figured I'd throw out five of my
favorites that most people out there are probably not listening to right
now, and may not have even heard of. Try something new!

In no particular order...

  [![Pop Will Eat Itself - Cure For Sanity](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61V-hKwrMSL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008JIR?tag=mhsvortex)   [**Pop Will Eat Itself - *Cure For Sanity***](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008JIR?tag=mhsvortex) -Â  You may recognize the name [Clint Mansell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell) from his film score work, most recently for the movie *Black Swan*. Mansell was originally the lead singer for PWEI. I like most of PWEI's stuff, but this one is my favorite. 
                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                       Slightly interesting personal note: it's also one of the only two albums (along with *[Pretty Hate Machine](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00489YLBS?tag=mhsvortex)*) my mom ever confiscated from me when I was a kid because she didn't like the lyrics or, I assume, the electronic/percussive nature of the music. Sorry, Mom. I think I had another copy like a week after that. It's been one of my favorites since I originally heard it carpooling with my friend Molly to school. Still is.

  [![2nu - Ponderous](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FnIz72MsL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008LTZ?tag=mhsvortex)                         [**2nu - *Ponderous***](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008LTZ?tag=mhsvortex) - I'm not even sure how to classify this. It's more... "ambient spoken word" than straight music. If you recognize anything at all from this album, it'll be [the short-radio-run title song, "This is Ponderous."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gYIbMwswKM) 
                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                       "I had this dream the other night. I went to work one day and nobody remembered who I was. So I decided to take the day off."

  [![Afghan Whigs - Gentlemen](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OYg70Gv7L._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002HD5?tag=mhsvortex)                [**Afghan Whigs - *Gentlemen***](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002HD5?tag=mhsvortex) - Great alternative album and a fantastic live show. This is actually the first concert I ever went to, with my buddy Mike. Super intimate venue that isn't there anymore where I also saw George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic (which was also a hell of a show)... but I digress. This is an awesome driving-around-town album. Go get it.

  [![Republica - Republica](http://ec5.images-amazon.com/images/I/518GQNvGrBL._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KEPLLO?tag=mhsvortex)                   [**Republica - *Republica***](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KEPLLO?tag=mhsvortex) - You probably heard this one (maybe even had it) and forgot about it entirely. Electronic rock you want to play with the volume turned up and the windows rolled down.

  [![Utah Saints - Utah Saints](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415P4N2DJ2L._SL500_AA250_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001FHK?tag=mhsvortex)               [**Utah Saints - *Utah Saints***](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001FHK?tag=mhsvortex) - Great house music, period. If you're into that sort of thing and you don't have this one, it's a must-have.
