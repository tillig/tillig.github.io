![Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory]({{ site.url }}/images/20050808wonka.jpg)On
Friday I went to see the latest version of Roald Dahl's [*Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/) as seen on
the big screen. Huge screen, in fact, as [I saw it in an IMAX
theater](http://www.imax.com/ImaxWeb/filmDetail.do?type=nowPlaying&movieID=code__.__47523).

 I didn't go in expecting much. [The original
movie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009FGWLW/mhsvortex)
holds a special place in my heart with its songs and [Gene
Wilder's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000698/) couldn't-care-less Willy
Wonka.

 I came out very pleasantly surprised.

 [Tim Burton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/) took the film in a
more true-to-the-book direction (at least, so I've heard; it's been
years since I read the book and don't remember too well), and did a
great job at it. Plus, with the usual Tim Burton surreal thing going on,
it all came together to be pretty darn entertaining.

 [Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/) did a great job as a
pretty freaky Wonka with some pretty obvious family issues. I was
worried about how he'd be able to pull off the character, but he did a
fantastic job and made it his own, without a hint of the Gene Wilder
influence. (That's actually what I was more afraid of - that it'd be a
bad imitation of an excellent Gene Wilder performance.)

 The story was slightly updated, too, to account for more recent times.
Mike Teavee, for example, was a video game addict rather than just a TV
addict. Of course, once Wonka's factory was entered, all that went out
the window anyway.

 Which actually brings us to Wonka's factory - excellent job on the
rendition of that. In some cases, particularly the first room they enter
where the chocolate waterfall is, it was just like the original movie,
but in others, like the invention room, it was entirely new. A pretty
good vision for what such a place should look like. And the Great Glass
Elevator? *Way* better than the original movie.

 The Oompa Loompas were done very differently from the original movie,
and each style has its merits. I'm not sure I was into the outfits the
new Loompas had on - the original movie had funnier costumes that I
liked. The new Loompas were more playful, though, and I think some of
that was missing from the original movie. Plus the songs were more
authentic in this latest version, which was cool. (No "Oompa Loompa
Doompity Do" in this one.)

 I think the IMAX theater added to the surreal nature of the film. The
camera angles and sets, which were already pretty crazy, were just made
more crazy by the larger-than-life size of the screen combined with the
curvature of the IMAX dome. (That's the only downside to seeing a
regular movie in IMAX - the screen curves, which takes some getting used
to and sort of makes you a little motion sick at times. Plus it's so big
it's hard to figure out what to focus on at any given time. Movies that
are originally filmed in IMAX don't have this problem because the
filming accounts for the curvature.)

 All in all, I liked it, and recommend seeing it. Maybe at matinee
prices, or rental - it wasn't $10-a-seat-in-a-regular-theater worthy,
but if you get a chance to check it out on IMAX, do it. Pretty cool
stuff.
