I've been lamenting the fact that
[JHymn](http://hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/) can't deal with the latest
iTunes DRM. So much so that I haven't upgraded to iTunes 6 and have
consequently been having odd crashes whenever I search the iTunes store.
(Why remove the DRM? Because it locks me into only playing the songs I
bought through iTunes - for example, the iPod support on Xbox 360 won't
let you play protected songs, and I think I should be able to play the
stuff I bought wherever I want.)
 
 Seems there's potentially a new sheriff in town: [myFairTunes6
v0.2b](http://hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1555)
 
 Might have to get [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) to give this a
go. (It's his turn to be the guinea pig.)
