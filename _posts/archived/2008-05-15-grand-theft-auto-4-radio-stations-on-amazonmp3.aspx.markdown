Rockstar has released the tracks from the radio stations in Grand Theft
Auto 4 as MP3 downloads from Amazon. 256kbps, which is decent quality,
though I'd honestly prefer lossless. May have to pick some of these up
anyway.

Here are the tracks from my favorite radio station, Radio Vladivostok.
My favorite tracks are "Zelenglazoe Taksi," "Schweine," "Wild Dances,"
and "O tebe." You can get all of the tracks from all of the stations
at [The Music of Grand Theft
Auto](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D491304011%26pf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dhero-quick-promo%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D1FJZ82K2NCTJ6FTT95PX%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D201%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D391315901%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3DB0018GB252&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325).
