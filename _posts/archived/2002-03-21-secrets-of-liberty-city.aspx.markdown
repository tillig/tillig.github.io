Jenn is gonna be *so pissed*...
 
 I went to this [Cheat Code Central](http://www.cheatcc.com/) site and
found all these secrets and cheats for Grand Theft Auto 3. There's a
bunch of stuff I didn't know about, like if you get a certain number of
these hidden packages that are stuck around the city then you get more
weapons that regenerate around your hideout. That's cool, since right
now I just get a baseball bat and a gun would be handy. There are also
all of these hidden missions around the city...
 
 Looks like I'll be spending some quality PS2 time tonight. I hope. :)
 
 Talked to my mom at the [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/) main
office and it looks like I may be SOL as far as the Tom Jones selection
at Freddy's. Guess I'll have to hit [Tower](http://www.towerrecords.com)
or something this weekend. *Sigh.* Not that I'm disappointed to go to
Tower, but I was hoping to have my Tom fix sooner rather than later. Oh,
well.
 
 I ate some [Red Vines](http://www.candywarehouse.com/redvinlictwi.html)
this morning and it reminded me how good they are. I hadn't had them for
a while. Tasty! Something I don't understand, though: [*black* Red
Vines](http://www.candywarehouse.com/blacredvinli.html). Shouldn't Red
Vines be, well, RED?
 
 Maybe I'll have to get some Red Vines this weekend. A tub of those
things lasts forever, regardless of how much you eat. It's like magic.
 
 I've got this set of
[Rollerscape](http://www.lagoongames.com/uk/loncran/mn_gadg.html#r) in
my cube. It's pretty sweet. I'm thinking I need more pieces, though,
since the size of the marble raceways you can build with the starter set
is a little limited. I need to be able to build something that's, like,
as tall as I am. It'd be much more impressive that way.
