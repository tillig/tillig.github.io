I love that Microsoft has gone on a security kick and is starting to
lock things down, but let me offer a thought: The reason most desktop
users don't use Linux is because it's *too fucking complex to
configure*. To that end, I just read an article about [how to enable
remote debugging once you've installed Windows XP
SP2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/xpsp2remotedebug.asp).
What a pain in the ass. I can only imagine what other software hoops I'm
going to have to jump through to get the simplest things to work. I
should probably [read up on
that](http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/productinfo/xpsp2/default.aspx).
