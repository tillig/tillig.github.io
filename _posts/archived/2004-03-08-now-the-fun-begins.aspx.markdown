It's turning out that, while searching for the house was the most
grueling part of the process, the coordination of all of the post-offer
efforts is like a novelty plate-spinning act. This weekend I scheduled a
U-Haul truck for the move. Thus far today, I have:

-   Locked down an interest rate on my 80% conventional loan
-   Called the insurance company to get my homeowner's policy started (I
    now have a questionnaire to fill out)
-   Turned in my earnest money check ($5000... that's a large check)
-   Contacted my mortgage broker and received a new Good Faith Estimate
    based on the tax and homeowner's insurance numbers I know
-   Scheduled time off for the Monday and Tuesday we're moving
-   Called the house inspector and left a message to schedule the
    inspection
-   Got recommendations on a moving company so I can schedule that



 That's all just one day. There's a lot more to go, too - this is just
the beginning. Jenn asked me if I thought the time would go by quickly
or slowly and I'm saying quickly; there's not enough time to schedule
and coordinate everything.

 You know how they have wedding planners that take care of orchestrating
weddings? They need to have home-buying planners that take care of all
the steps involved with buying a home. From picking the mortgage broker
and the realtor to getting the U-Haul together and the house inspection
done. There's your million-dollar business idea for the day.
