We heard back from the vetÂ with the final [autopsy results on
Jack](/archive/2008/05/30/his-name-was-jack.aspx). He did have
inflammatory bowel disorder, as we suspected, but other than that, he
was perfectly healthy. A consult with an anesthesiologist turned up that
it was most likely a case of "[epinephrine
reversal](http://www.drugs.com/dict/epinephrine-reversal.html)." The way
the vet described it, the pre-anesthetic sedative they gave him had an
adverse effect that basically took down his blood pressure in a wildly
unexpected way. It happens in animals that get really stressed out - for
example, it's common with horses because horses get stressed easily.
It's virtually unheard of in cats. That, and Jack wasn't exhibiting any
stress-related behavior. Aside from him just not liking the IV and
catheter (who does?), he was fine.

There really isn't any way we could have detected it or avoided it. He
needed to be checked out so we could help him with his condition and
treat it correctly, and this was the only way to do that. Even if we had
skipped it now, who's to say it wouldn't happen in some future medical
scenario.

The doctor is continuing to look into ways to prevent it from happening
to other animals, but it looks like... well, "it just happens."
