Ah, the beauty and inherent magic of the Venti<sup>tm</sup> Mocha
[Frappuccino](http://www.starbucks.com/grocery/frappucino.asp)®. So
tasty. In fact, I don't think I even know how to order anything else at
[Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/). I went in today and thought I
might try something new, maybe one of those fruity tea-based things, but
the only words I could speak when I reached the register were, "[Venti
Mocha Frappuccino](http://www.eeggs.com/items/3067.html)."
 
 And then, before I could think twice about it, there it was, in all its
splendor. Mmmm.
 
 I'm feeling a little nostalgic today, streaming my mix of 80's MP3s on
my [ShoutCast](http://www.shoutcast.com) server at work. (No, it's not
available outside our firewall. Sorry.) The
[Poison](http://www.poisonweb.com/) song *[Talk Dirty To
Me](http://www.wcafe.com/poison/catlyrc.htm#dirty)* just came on. Bad
hair band? Of course. Remind me of a pleasant time gone by? Hell, yeah.
Sometimes you just need a little hair band music to put things right.
 
 I took a test on [emode.com](http://www.emode.com/) today that
supposedly was going to tell me what my ultimate career would be. It
told me my ideal job would allow me to be "Analytical and Creative." No
shit. But to tell me actual careers that fit the profile, they wanted
\$15. I think not. Besides, my current job lets me be analytical and
creative aplenty, even if it is programming. I think I'll stick with
what I've got.
 
 I set up my [Tron light
cycles](http://www.emerchandise.com/browse/TRON/ACTIONFI/) today in a
cool action-oriented way on my desk. A pack-and-a-half of the [small
Post-It®](http://products.mmm.com/us/office/products/office.jhtml?powurl=LLBDNTCB0VgsGSZCZYKRQ9geGST1T4S9TCgv00NFHNQV8Ngl6N9T409Q2Sbl)
notes works great to prop them up so they don't fall over. Now as long
as the cleaning lady doesn't mess it up, it'll stay cool.
