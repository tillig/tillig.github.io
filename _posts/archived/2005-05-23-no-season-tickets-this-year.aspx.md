After much deliberation, Jenn and I have decided not to get full season
hockey tickets for the [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) this
year. We love hockey, we love our seats, and we love the people we sit
by. We just can't make it to 36 home games over the course of a season,
and we can't justify spending the money on the tickets anymore. The
Hawks have taken too long to "rebuild;" there are too many Memorial
Coliseum games when they should be in the Rose Garden; and we always
tell each other we'll go on vacation when we have the time and money...
but with 36 games to go to, there's no time, and at the prices they're
charging, there's no money.
 
 This was actually a really hard decision that we chewed on for several
weeks. We really do love our seats - right on the glass! Front row
hockey action! And the people we sit by are really good friends - we
couldn't ask for better seat neighbors. Those were the two factors
making us reluctant to not get the season tix - the seats and the
people. Sadly, the factors against (money, time, etc.) barely outweighed
and now we're going to step down for a partial season ticket package
instead.
 
 I'll be honest - the real push for me was the time. I do love the
hockey. 36 home games, though? It's like every single night you're
having to haul ass downtown. I've really been enjoying not having to run
around so much during the off-season and I really just can't see getting
back into that crazy shuffle. Six or seven times in a season? Sure.
Twice a week for several months? Too much. Far too much.
 
 So we'll lose our seats, which I'm sorry to do, and we'll have to run
down to visit our friends during intermissions. But we'll actually plan
and go on a vacation this year, which, I think, will make up for it.
Cancun? Disneyland? The sky is the limit!
