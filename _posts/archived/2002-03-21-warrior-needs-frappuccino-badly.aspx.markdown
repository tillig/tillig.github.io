There's something about a [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com)
Frappuccino that just gets me going. Nothing like a Venti\* Mocha
Frappuccino right before work. I got one this morning with my
friend/coworker/boss Greg at the local [Barnes &
Noble](http://www.bn.com). Really just hit the spot. More [probably]
later...
 
 *\* "Venti" is actually a trademarked word of Starbucks, which I really
don't understand because it's Italian for "twenty." How do you trademark
a number? What's that all about?*
