I've gone through and re-listed all of my t-shirts (individually, this
time) on [eBay](http://www.ebay.com). Since the "lot of 10" didn't sell,
here's hoping they'll sell individually. I also put in starting prices
instead of reserves, since it seems folks don't like reserve auctions
(at least, the people I talk to don't).

 We'll see what happens this time. Luckily it only costs me like $0.35
per shirt to list the things.
