Important things first: I've finished finding all of the hidden packages
on the first island in [Grand Theft Auto
3](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/) and now I've made it
to the second island. I've been doing mostly taxi missions to get to
know the place, but I've done a couple of regular missions, too. The
place is huge! I had enough trouble getting to know Portland and now
Staunton Island is here. My work is cut out for me.

 Thank goodness for [GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com).

 Got a link today to probably the scariest thing in the world - US
Attorney General Ashcroft [singing a "patriotic hymn" of his own
concoction](http://www.cnn.com/video/us/2002/02/25/ashcroft.sings.wbtv.med.html).
Give me a frickin' break.

 I'm trying to find a decent stuffed [Domokun](http://www.domomode.com)
doll. A guy at [www.domo-kun.de](http://www.domo-kun.de) has some links
to online stores, but they're always out of the one I want - if you
squeeze the doll, his arms flap. If anyone out there knows where to get
one of these in the US, leave a comment. Thanks.
