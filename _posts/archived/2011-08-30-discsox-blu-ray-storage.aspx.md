I have [a lot of DVDs and they get stored in
binders](/archive/2011/05/20/media-storage.aspx), but I don't have so
many Blu-ray discs and I like to keep them separate from the DVDs. I
don't rip the Blu-rays to my movie server, so it's good to have them a
little more accessible.

I had previously been storing them on a shelf like books in a library,
but the shelf is out of space and things are looking bad. Time to find
something else.

Trucking around [The Container Store](http://www.containerstore.com) I
found [these DiscSox HiDef Pro
Sleeves](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004HCC8JI?tag=mhsvortex) that are the
perfect solution.

These sleeves allow you to store two discs per sleeve and the cover is
actually the cover from the Blu-ray case, so it's a nice browsing
experience. For the fewer-than-65 Blu-ray discs I have, this is great.
Recommended.
