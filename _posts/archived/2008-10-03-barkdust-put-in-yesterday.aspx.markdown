We had a fresh layer of barkdust blown in yesterday. We do it every two
or three years, and getting it blown in (rather than spreading it
yourself) is far and away a better way to go.

I always forget what kind of barkdust we get, or who we use, though, so
it's always a pain to get it scheduled for the next time. This time,
I'll blog it - so I can find it again later!

We got **one unit of medium fresh fir**, which is enough to cover all
the beds we have. It cost \$295 this year, up from \$215 three years
ago. (Price of gas, I guess.)

We used [**Grimm's Advanced Bark
Blowing**](http://www.grimmsfuel.com/blower.htm). We've had ProGrass do
it before, too, but they're slightly more expensive. Grimm's does a
really good job at a decent price. Done and done.
