I got [JHymn](http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/) set up and running
to perform almost exactly the same action as my [M4P Backup
script](/archive/2004/12/29/m4p-backupdecryption-script.aspx). The
difference is that my backup script created the unlocked M4A file in the
same folder as the original M4P, then copied *both* the M4A and M4P into
the backup location; the configuration of JHymn that I'm using just
creates the M4A in the backup location - it doesn't back up the M4P, nor
does it place a copy of the M4A alongside the original M4P. Other
configurations of JHymn can do things like replace the original M4P with
the decoded M4A... but I didn't want to go that route.

 Anyway, here's my JHymn configuration. I've upgraded to iTunes 4.7.1
and everything works fine. Click the screen shots to get a larger view.
