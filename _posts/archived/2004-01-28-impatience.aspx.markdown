Call me impatient, but it's been 45 minutes and no word from the
mortgage broker. Fuck this, man. I put in a request for consultation
from [MortgageDesignGroup.com](http://www.mortgagedesigngroup.com/), so
we'll see how that goes. Supposedly I'm going to hear from someone
within 48 hours.

 According to their site, rates are nice and low and I might be able to
get somewhere between 5.5% and 6.125%. Not too bad; might mean I can get
a better house.
