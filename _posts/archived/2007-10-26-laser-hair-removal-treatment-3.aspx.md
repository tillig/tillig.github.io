It was four weeks since [my second hair removal
treatment](/archive/2007/09/25/laser-hair-removal-treatment-2.aspx) and
eight [since my
first](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx) as of
this past Saturday, so once again I headed in to get my face zapped.

My second treatment used the [Aesthera Isolaz](http://www.isolaz.com/)
IPL in an attempt to get me some reasonably pain-free results.  While it
was far, far lower in pain magnitude, I really didn't see much in the
way of results.  In fact, I could barely tell anything was done at all.
As such, this third treatment we went back to the [Dermo
Flash](http://sanadome.nl/sanadomeEN/health/dermoflash.html) since that
had a reasonable balance of pain and results.

My normal technician was sick, so I got a different lady zapping me.
She said she totally didn't blame me for sticking with the Dermo Flash -
the [MeDioStar](http://www.medsurgeadvances.com/mediostar_xt.php) does
get overall better results but she has yet to find any guy who can take
the pain involved (it's apparently that much more intense when used on
coarse male hair).  She did one guy's beard and by the end was almost in
tears herself with watching how much pain the guy was in, and he was on
his own pain killers.  So... no MeDioStar laser for me, thanks.  I'll
stick with Dermo Flash.
