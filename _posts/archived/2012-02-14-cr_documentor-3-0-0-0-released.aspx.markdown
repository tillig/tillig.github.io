The latest version of CR\_Documentor, 3.0.0.0,Â  [has been
released](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/downloads/list).

This version is an update to .NET 4 in preparation for [a VSIX-based
installer](/archive/2012/02/01/how-to-add-a-vsix-installer-to-a-dxcore-plugin.aspx)
(think [Visual Studio
Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/)) so **it will
only support Visual Studio 2010**.

It also resolves a small issue where some interfaces changed in DXCore
11.2.8 and the plugin was throwing exceptions. **You will need the
latest CodeRush/Refactor/DXCore (11.2.8) or things may not work.** (I
admittedly haven't tried it on earlier versions.)

Free, as always, [so go get
it!](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/downloads/list) And watch
for the VSIX installer, coming soon!
