The folks over at Tested.com have created a nice guide to show you [how
to rip your DVDs to play on any
device](http://www.tested.com/news/how-to-rip-dvds-to-play-on-any-devicefor-free/19/).
Basically they walk you through the preferred settings in
[Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) for each device and explain what each
device supports.

To me, it looks like you'll end up with a different copy of the movie
for just about every device. It also won't work for my purposes since
part of the goal of [my media center/DVD
library](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx)
is to use the library as a backup for the discs in case they go bad;
recompressing, removing the extras/menus, etc. sort of defeats that
purpose.

Nevertheless, a good guide, especially if you're just looking to stream
the movie content.
