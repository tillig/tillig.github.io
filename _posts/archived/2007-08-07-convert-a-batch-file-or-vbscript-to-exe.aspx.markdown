There is so much stuff out there that I have no idea exists.  Anyone
else know that there's a program that come with Windows called
"IEXPRESS.EXE" that basically makes installers?  Anyone know [you could
use this thing to convert a .BAT or .VBS to an
.EXE](http://renegadetech.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-convert-bat-file-or-vbs-file.html)?

Yeah, neither did I.
