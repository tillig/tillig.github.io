I usually think code humor is pretty lame, but I was *dying* with [this
one](http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/9reasons.asp). (Which may not
be funny to those who didn't read the [*Nine Reasons Not To Use
Serialization*](http://www.codeproject.com/showcase/noserialise.asp) [in
.NET] article and realize why it's a load of crap. Or to those who just
don't care.)
