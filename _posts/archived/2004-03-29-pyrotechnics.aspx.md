This weekend was pretty eventful. Besides spending the majority of
Sunday packing, cleaning, and painting, Saturday afternoon was spent in
a pyrotechnician training course put on by [Western Display
Fireworks](http://www.westerndisplay.com/). Jenn and I both went, and
over the course of about five hours they went over all of the Oregon
State Fire Marshal rules for fireworks.
 
 The first part was a little dry because it was geared for people who
transport fireworks (like, commercial drivers and such). I'm not a
driver, so it wasn't too interesting. The second part was better,
though, as they reviewed the rules and regulations for putting on
fireworks displays and such.
 
 After the class, Jenn and I both took the General Operator
Certification test, so we can be licensed pyros. We'll have to shoot
three shows in the next couple years if we want the actual
certification, but we did one last year, so only two to go. Might be
cool. (Interesting side note: the guy teaching the class, who is also
the president of Western Display Fireworks, has pyro certification \#1
in the state of Oregon. Kinda cool.)
 
 After the test they had a product demonstration where they'd announce
what kind of firework they were going to shoot and then fire one off to
show you what different things do. During one of the demonstrations, a
box of two-inch mortars either split or fell over or something and
started shooting *at us*. Pandemonium ensued, but thankfully no one was
hurt. One guy fell off his bench and hit his head, but he was fine. It
was sort of funny to watch the instructor guy, though - he just sat
there and took it all in. Didn't even flinch. I guess you get
comfortable with some things after you're exposed to them for long
enough.
