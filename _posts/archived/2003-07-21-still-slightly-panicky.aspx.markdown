I'm still a little panicky about my certification tests. I know I sound
like a broken record, but at $125 a pop, pass or fail, it's pretty
important that I pass the first time.

 I went to the bookstore to check out some books in a series called
*Exam Cram*, since a friend of mine at work recommended them, but they
didn't have any of the ones I needed. I looked at the ones they did
have, to get a feel for how they are laid out, and they look pretty
decent, but it's like 300 pages of information that I don't want to have
to pick through to figure out the important parts. I mean, isn't that
what the self test software is for? To show me what I need to know and
drill me via flash cards? So I think I may just try the first test using
the self test software and the knowledge in my head, as useless as that
may be.

 Time to go download [brain dumps](http://www.mcsebraindumps.com)...
