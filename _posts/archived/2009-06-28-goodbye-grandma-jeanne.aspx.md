![My grandma, Jeanne Ann Illig: 1922 -
2009]({{ site.url }}/images/20090628grandmajeanne.jpg)A
couple of weeks ago, on June 11, my paternal grandmother passed away.
She had been having some age-related health problems for a while, so it
wasn't a surprise, but it was still a sad loss.

We lived next door to my grandparents when I was a kid and visited them
a lot. There was a path cut from our backyard to theirs so we could get
there without walking along the road. It feels like it wasn't that long
ago where she was out playing baseball with us out there. I loved her a
lot and those are some great memories I'll have with me always.

Grandma was actually a very talented artist. My family has some amazing
pencil drawings she did as a young lady. She didn't pursue it into her
later years, but she always encouraged us kids to follow our artistic
passions.
