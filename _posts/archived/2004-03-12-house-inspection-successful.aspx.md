My house inspection was successful except for some pretty minor
cosmetics:

-   There's a cracked tile in the kitchen countertop
-   The grout around the kitchen sink needs to be touched up
-   The trim around the front door needs to be repainted
-   There's a spackled area above the front door that needs some
    touch-up paint
-   There's a dime-sized area on the ceiling above the storage closet
    under the stairs that has lost its texture
-   There's some ceiling patching in the kitchen that needs to be
    painted up (it looks like they've had some settling cracks that they
    had repaired; I'm waiting to hear back on a confirmation that that's
    all it was)
-   There are some loose electrical wires (presumedly not hot wires) in
    the crawl space that need to be bundled up and properly terminated



 Since that all went according to plan and I was able to go back there
and spend some time taking pictures, as promised, [I posted some
pictures in my photo gallery for those curious to see what the house
looks like](http://www.mildperil.net/pix/categories.php?cat_id=6).

 I also promised some specs/stats, so here you go:

-   2315 square feet (1151 upstairs, 1164 downstairs)
-   Vinyl siding
-   Composite roofing
-   4 bedrooms and a bonus room (master bedroom, two regular bedrooms,
    bonus room, and an office... but I think they count the office as a
    bedroom)
-   2.5 baths
-   Built-in microwave, range, oven
-   Gas fireplace (with blower)
-   Walk-in closet and bath off master
-   Gas heat
-   Air conditioning
-   Maple cabinets and tile counters in kitchen
-   Oak hardwood floors (not Pergo!) in the entryway and kitchen
-   Two-car garage with automatic opener



 I hope that's enough for those of you craving more info. Again, I
highly encourage you to [check out the
pictures](http://www.mildperil.net/pix/categories.php?cat_id=6) and see
what you think!
