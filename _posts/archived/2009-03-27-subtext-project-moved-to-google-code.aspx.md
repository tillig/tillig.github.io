The Subtext blog project has moved its home from SourceForge [over to
Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/subtext/). The code finished
migrating over today and the SourceForge project has been marked
read-only. I'm excited - the interface is so much lighter weight and
easy to get around in. [Check it
