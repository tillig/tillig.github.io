I finished [*Ghost Recon: Advanced
Warfighter*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0EFJW/mhsvortex)
on the "Normal" difficulty a couple of days ago, so I'm thinking I might
try it out on the "Hard" difficulty just to see. I haven't yet jumped
online with it, either, and I'm tempted to, but somehow the idea of
getting into a game with a bunch of 12-year-olds yelling arbitrary
profanity at me doesn't sound too enticing. That said, maybe I'll give
it a run anyway.

 Jenn's bridal shower was on Saturday and while that was going on I
headed over to [Stu's](http://www.stuartthompson.net) new place to put
in a few units\* on
[*Oblivion*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BI3QK2/mhsvortex).
Jenn ended up getting several very nice things from folks and it sounds
like she had a great time, which is good, since you don't get a bridal
shower every week.

 I, of course, felt pretty good about the units put in and look forward
to the next set of units.

 \* A "unit" is roughly defined as a "large block of time dedicated to a
single task." The original definition derives from when Stu and I were
playing [*Soul Calibur
III*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000935256/mhsvortex) and
had to fight the last character so many times before [we finally beat
him](/archive/2006/02/13/strife-is-dead.aspx) that it became a running
joke.
