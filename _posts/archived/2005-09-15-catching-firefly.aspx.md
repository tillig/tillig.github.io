I noticed that the movie
[*Serenity*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/) was coming out, and I
had previously heard how good the show
[*Firefly*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS0F/mhsvortex)
was (before it was cancelled), so when I saw
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/mhsvortex) was
having a half-off sale on [Joss
Whedon](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/) DVDs, I picked up a copy.

 *Damn, it's good.*

 That said, I can totally see why folks didn't take to it. It's a
little... eclectic. When I heard people describe it as a "Western in
space" I didn't think it was so *literal*. I mean, they'll ride horses
then hop into their ship... or they'll haul cattle in the spaceship...
or they'll pull a train heist on a mag-lev train using their ship...
It's very much, very literally, a "Western in space."

 But it's *so good*. You really get to know and like the characters,
which is something sorely missing from many television shows nowadays.
And the eclectic nature of the show is itself a draw factor for me,
though I can see that it would be more of a turn-off to the standard
boob-tube-watching population.

 Plus, [Tim Minear](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0591101/) worked on it,
and he (as well as Joss Whedon) always seems to work on shows that I get
to love then promptly get cancelled. There are only two redeeming
factors - first, I get to watch the show nonstop without commercials;
second, they're coming out with a movie just in time.

 If you get a chance, [check it
out](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AQS0F/mhsvortex). It's
like finding buried treasure.
