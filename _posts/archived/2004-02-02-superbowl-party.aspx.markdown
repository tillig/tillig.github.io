Jenn and I didn't do a whole lot this weekend, but we did go to a
[Superbowl](http://www.superbowl.com) party at a friend's place.
 
 Interesting way I met these friends, actually: I was in a geology class
at [PSU](http://www.pdx.edu) and was talking to a classmate, telling her
that I was going to get a job at [Lattice
Semiconductor](http://www.latticesemi.com). She said her husband
happened to work there (small world, right)? So I ended up going to
school with her and working with her husband.
 
 Anyway, they're cool people and always have a great Superbowl party
(lots of people and food) but I haven't gone in the past couple of
years, so it was good to go this year. Not only did I catch up with them
(and see their kids finally) but I also got to see a lot of friends I
used to work with who I have lost touch with. It was really great to see
all of them, and hopefully I won't be so long in seeing them again.
