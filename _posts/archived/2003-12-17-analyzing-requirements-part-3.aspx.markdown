Okay, well technically speaking it's not the end of the day today yet,
but I'm going to post now because it's lunchtime and I have time to do
it.
 
 The class is still pretty boring, but now we're into the "how to design
your database" section of things and, having already taken the SQL
Server classes and having designed several databases myself, we're into
familiar territory. Not only that, but the teacher and the rest of the
students seem to be more engaged, which brings the energy of the room up
a few notches.
 
 I went to Jenn's VA Christmas Party last night and had an okay time.
There were about 20 people from her pharmacy group that showed up, but
she only knew a few of them. I spoke to the head of the VA pharmacy
stuff for a while about Krispy Kreme donuts and apparently I had a
longer conversation with him than Jenn has ever had with him. He seemed
nice.
 
 I talked to my dad last night and he says he wants to sign up to be on
the next *Survivor* show, so I have to help him come up with ideas for
his tryout video. I don't know what the guy's thinking; he's got a bad
back, he can't see without his glasses, and he's got terrible pollen
allergies so bad he can't mow the lawn. I'm not sure how far he thinks
he's going to get on the thing, but you know what? I hope he goes all
the way (assuming he can get on the show). He's been wanting to get on
one of these reality shows for the longest time. More power to him.
 
 At least I know he'll be entertaining to watch on TV, right?
