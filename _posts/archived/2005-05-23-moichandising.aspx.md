I'm not sure why it is, but *Star Wars* is like lube for my wallet. I am
compelled - like at the soul level - to buy *Star Wars* toys. Not just
any old merchandise, mind you, but action figures and vehicles.

 I've seen episode III twice since Friday. This weekend I bought like
five figures and two of the vehicles. I'd probably have bought more had
the store carried the rest of the vehicles. And to be honest, I have no
idea why. It just makes me happy.

 Just seeing the opening *Star Wars* logo and hearing the fanfare makes
me smile. I think that, combined with the fact that I never really had
any *Star Wars* toys growing up (and those that I did have got sold out
from under me at a garage sale) sort of adds up to me buying toys I
probably don't *need* but really, truly *want*.

 I saw more on Amazon that I want but I realize I should probably not
indulge much more. Jenn's already told me to stop buying the toys. But
I'm an addict! Just one more figure!
