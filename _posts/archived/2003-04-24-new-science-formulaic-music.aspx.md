I've [mentioned this idea
before](/archive/2002/08/29/edge-of-seventeen.aspx), but I keep thinking
about it so I thought I'd expand on it here: The idea that music can be
represented by a mathematical equation of some nature and can
potentially be analyzed for certain qualities that can be reproduced in
other songs.

 First we need to find a way to accurately represent music
mathematically; that is, to be able to model every aspect of a piece of
music numerically. This would have to include the type of instruments
being played, the notes themselves, the quality of the singer's voice,
the rhythm, the volume... every possible quality of a given piece of
music.

 Then we need to do this modeling for several pieces of music. Model
similar pieces - pieces by the same composer, pieces played by the same
band/orchestra. Discover the similarities in the pieces. Now model very
dissimilar pieces. What makes them different from each other?

 With enough data, you could generate a model for how music looks
mathematically. From that model, you could potentially create a formula
for the generation of other pieces of music.

 This would totally revolutionize the music industry as we know it.
Someone needs a song, they plug in a few parameters into the formula and
out pops a new hit tune. People could create a song-generating machine -
push a few buttons, it prints out the sheet music with all the
arrangements and everything for a pop hit or a new symphony.

 What would that mean for creativity? Would it mean that good
songwriters are the people who naturally understand this equation? Would
it put the songwriters out of business? Or would it change the way songs
need to be written? Maybe both?
