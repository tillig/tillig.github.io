It's been a little while (hey, I've been busy!) so I figured I'd start
this fine day out with a Traffic Asshole.
 
 Today's is less a "Traffic Asshole" than a "Parking Asshole." This
right here is why I hate people who own large trucks:
 
 ![Parking on the line doesn't mean you're in the
space.](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pGf8nVM1CUcr97QeGJVYOn9kPtGs35j9uX8-yrOEY9ylPtDX9waIZf_FRLGoKmuqb13nhFbierGWlhZbK7e5cORpLld1yWHAQxbq452_fsNU/20040311taotw.jpg?psid=1)
 
 Here are a couple of pointers for those of you who somehow feel the
need to buy gigantic trucks even though you don't go off road and you
don't haul anything:
 
 **Don't park in compact spaces.** See the label on the space that says
"COMPACT?" Your truck doesn't qualify. Don't try it, it's not going to
fit. Even if you squint, it's not coming close. Go park in the larger
spots. It will probably be less convenient, but that's the price you pay
for wasting our natural resources.
 
 **Parking on the line doesn't mean you're in the spot.** If your tire's
riding the line, especially if it's all the way *on the line*, you're
not in the spot. You need to be *between* the lines. Pretend those lines
are walls. You can't park *in* the wall, can you? Of course not. Don't
park in the line, either.
 
 **It's okay to try again.** If you get out of your behemoth and you see
you're not quite in the space, nobody cares if you get back in and
correct yourself. In fact, I'd wager people would *openly encourage you*
to resolve the situation. Back 'er up and try again. There's no shame in
it.
 
 If you follow these handy parking tips, I think the world in general
would be a better place. Wars would cease and famine would end. I bet
they'd find a cure for the common cold and cancer. All you have to do is
*try*. For all our sakes, *please try*.
