Before I really get into other things, I realize, looking back, that I
didn't say anything about the fact that the [Oregon Air
Show](http://www.oregonairshow.com/) was this past weekend. Living near
the Hillsboro Airport hasn't ever been a problem (I don't ever hear any
air traffic - I'm not *that* close), but in cases like this it's
actually a benefit. My parents, Jenn's parents, Jenn's sister, and
Jenn's niece all came over and we barbecued and watched the show. It was
cool - the [Blue Angels](http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/) flew close to
rooftop level (low enough you could read the writing on the plane) right
over my house and down my street.
 
 Anyway.
 
 Lots of change going on at work.
 
 I've had this [Wireless IntelliMouse
Explorer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NVBT/mhsvortex)
(cordless USB mouse) I've been using for the past few months. I like the
wireless mouse thing, but I've noticed that this one seems to suck up
batteries pretty quickly, on the order of a pair of batteries every
three weeks or so. When the batteries get low (which I'm sure means
they're at half-strength), the mouse response gets crappy, like there's
signal interference or something.
 
 After a few months of that, I've had enough and have switched back to a
corded mouse. It's [the same mouse, just with a
cord](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005TQ09/mhsvortex). Now
I need to get a [decent rechargeable wireless
mouse](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006HZ0L/mhsvortex). Not
the highest of priorities, but definitely on the list.
 
 I've also changed jobs. As of Monday, August 16, I'm officially moved
out of the Corporate Information Technologies department and now I'm in
Applications Engineering. I'll be working on actual product code now
instead of corporate internal applications, which I think will be a Cool
Thing. I've been doing mostly product-related stuff anyway lately, might
as well do it officially. I move my stuff to a new cube in the
Engineering area tomorrow. I've already taken down the [Harry Potter
Legos](/archive/2002/03/01/the-philosophers-legos.aspx)... my cube is
looking very empty. Of course, the new cube is like half the size of my
current one, so I don't have room for all of my toys.
