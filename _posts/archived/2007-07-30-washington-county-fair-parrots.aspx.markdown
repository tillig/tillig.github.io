We went to the [Washington County
Fair](http://www.faircomplex.com/wcf2007/index.html) on Saturday and had
a blast.  There's something about going to the fair that's just
generally fun.  This time, they had this great show called ["The
Pirate's Parrot Show"](http://www.thepiratesparrot.com/) going on when
we got there.

The Pirate's Parrot show is this great show where this guy brings out
something like 15 parrots of different varieties and, dressed as a
pirate (of course), shows you different tricks with the parrots and
educates you about them.  None of the parrots are caged - they all just
wander around however they want to - and the highlight of the show is
him letting them fly freely around the area, passing very close
overhead.  It's definitely not something you see every day.  The whole
audience was sort of baffled about why the birds wouldn't just make a
break for it, but he explained that with an analogy: "Why do your kids
come back when they wander off?"  At the end of the show, he lets you
hold and pet the parrots and answers any questions you might have about
them.  All in all, a fantastic show.

Of course, we also had to partake in the fair food - BBQ pork
sandwiches, fresh lemonade, and funnel cake.  It really doesn't get much
better than that, though I'm glad we walked all over the place so at
least I could say I worked off two or three bites of that funnel cake. 
I'm sure my arteries are still irritated with me.

A heck of a lot of fun, and, [as Tom Peterson
says](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0677426/bio), "Free is a very good
price!"
