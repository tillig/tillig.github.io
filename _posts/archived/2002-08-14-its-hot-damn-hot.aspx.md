I saw a little guy in an orange robe just burst into flame. [It's that
hot!](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305144176/mhsvortex)

 Yesterday it was record heat in Portland. I guess it's the first time
in years it got over 100Â°F. It was also a record energy usage day. All I
know is it was hot, and it's gonna be hot today, too.

 I went in this morning to get allergy tested so I can start up on the
shots. As well as the medications work, I don't want to be reliant on
them. Jenn scared me by saying they were going to prick my back a
bazillion times and it'd itch so bad I couldn't stand it. That's not
actually what happened. What they did was they pricked my right arm a
few times with the major stuff - dust, grass, various pollens - and left
that for 15 minutes. Then they looked at the results for those and put a
more specific set of allergens on my left arm based on the results from
the right arm.

 Turns out I'm allergic to dust and most pollens. Big surprise there.

 It wasn't so bad, though. I can ignore my arm itching; my back would
have been a problem. Plus, the ones that reacted really quickly, before
the 15 minutes were up, got treated with some anti-itch lotion
immediately. No problem.

 Now I go in again next week to get tested one last time. They're going
to mix up a couple of possible shot treatments and I'll get tested to
see if I react badly to them. If not, I'm good to go and I can start
taking the shots weekly at a clinic much closer to my work. Excellent.

 ![Kelly

watched [*American Idol*](http://idolonfox.msn.com/) last night and I
must admit my [opinion](/archive/2002/07/17/american-idiots.aspx) has
changed as to who my favorite is. Up until fairly recently, I was a huge
[Nikki
McKibbin](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/nicky_ozmet/default.htm)
fan. As time has gone by, though, and I've seen more of what the various
contestants can do, I have to say that, while Nikki is fun and has a
great attitude and is original, she just doesn't meet the talent shown
by some of the other contestants. She's good, but not that good. (I'm
sorry Nikki, but it's true.)

 My new favorite is [Kelly
Clarkson](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/kelly_clarkson/default.htm).
She seems sort of next-door-girl-ish and is really, really good. After
her performance during the "Big Band" show, singing "Stuff Like That
There," I was converted. That girl can sing.

 I've also changed my opinion of the [stupid
hosts]({{ site.url }}/images/20020814stupidhosts.jpg)
on the show. Not only do I really hate them, I hate them so much that I
am starting to hate *myself* for putting up with them. I can't imagine,
right now, anyone I really hate more than them. Maybe Bin Laden.
*Maybe.*
