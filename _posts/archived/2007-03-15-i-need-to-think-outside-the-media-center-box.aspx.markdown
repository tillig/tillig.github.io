I've been locked into a way of thinking - that [for my media center
solution](/archive/2007/03/15/vista-ultimate-media-center-in-virtual-pc-form-not.aspx)
I need to get a Windows Media Center with some network attached storage
and connect all of that up so I can use the Xbox 360 as a Media Center
Extender to watch movies.

 I'm starting to think maybe I've been barking up the wrong tree and
it's time to re-examine my requirements and assumptions.

 There are a lot of limitations to Media Center Extender technology, not
the least of which is that they don't support playback of movies ripped
in either ISO or VIDEO\_TS format, which is one of my primary goals. I
not only want easy access to my movies, but I want no quality lost when
I put them on the server, I want no features lost (extras, audio tracks,
etc.), and I want to be able to re-create a watchable DVD from it should
my original die.

 So I need to open myself to new possible solutions:

-   Would it be better to have a dedicated home theater PC for each room
    where I want to access the movies? I could just have each one talk
    to the network attached storage device.
-   Is Windows Media Center really the answer? Is there some other
    Windows product that might do the job like
    [MediaPortal](http://www.team-mediaportal.com/)?
-   If I just go for a dedicated home theater PC, am I limiting myself
    with Windows? Would Mac and [Front
    Row](http://www.apple.com/imac/frontrow.html) or
    [iTheater](http://www.itheaterproject.com/index.php) be a better
    solution?
-   Is there some sort of hardware device *that just works* that I don't
    already know about?


 I'll continue to search, but I think I'm going to broaden the scope.
Unfortunately, I don't have a Mac that I can try this stuff out on, so
I'm going to have to do a lot of reading. I might try out MediaPortal on
a virtual machine to see how that goes. If anyone knows of any other
devices I should look at, let me know in comments.
