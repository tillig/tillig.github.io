In preparation for the wedding, Jenn and I are running around
registering for stuff. We don't need a lot since the house is pretty
well set up already with appliances and such, but we do need silverware
that didn't come as a mismatched set from
[Goodwill](http://www.goodwill.org) and we want new, nicer dishes.

 The problem is most standard dish sets are these heavy, clunky things
that look like rejects from a beginning pottery class and make me feel
like I'm in kindergarten.

 For a while I considered just eating on fine china every day (why
not?),
 but the thing stopping me is you can't put most fine china in the
microwave. I don't need oven-proof dishes, but they do need to be
dishwasher- and microwave-safe. Enter the notion of "casual china."

 To that end, we went Saturday to [Macy's](http://www.macys.com) and
registered for some awesome kate spade casual china from [the Gramercy
Park
collection](http://www.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=111108&CategoryID=12284).
Not the standard five-piece sets, though, since we never use saucers and
rarely use teacups, so we custom crafted a set together. They're pretty
sweet.

 That was pretty much the high point of the weekend. Planted some stuff
in the backyard. Saw [*The Devil Wears
Prada*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0458352/). Cleaned stuff up. The
usual.

 Next weekend is my birthday, so I should probably figure out what's
going on for that...
