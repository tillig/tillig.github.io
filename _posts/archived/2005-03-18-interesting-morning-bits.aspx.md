While cruising through my morning news, I've found...

 [Engadget reports on
PyMusique](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000267036571/), a program
that allows you to download music from iTunes without the DRM being
attached. Turns out iTunes itself is what creates the DRM when you buy
from the iTunes Music Store. This program buys from the iTunes music
store (you still have to pay) but doesn't add the DRM. I'm going to have
to check this out.

 Raymond Chen talks about [some interesting
trivia](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/18/398550.aspx)
regarding Windows XP service pack build numbers. If your Windows XP
version is *Version 5.1 (Build 2600.xpsp2.040919-1003 : Service Pack
1)*, are you running service pack 2 (as indicated by "xpsp2") or service
pack 1? (Turns out it's service pack 1; the *why* is the interesting
part.)

 Google's opened **[code.google.com](http://code.google.com/)**, a site
chock-full of Google-related code and API information. Wanna develop
against Google? That seems to be the place. Seems to be all C++ and
Python at the moment, but the plan is that more will be released later.
I may have to check this out.
