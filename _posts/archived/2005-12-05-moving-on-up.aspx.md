There are lots of things getting done lately, and I'm enjoying the
closure I'm getting on them so much that I think my creative juices are
flowing again - enough that working on new little side projects may be
an option.

 Friday night I got the last of my [Odyssey CD storage cases from Sleeve
City](http://www.sleevetown.com/) and finished the consolidation of CDs
from the several racks and bookshelves they previously took up into
three of these metal beauties. You wouldn't imagine how much space I'm
saving just on CDs.

 Saturday [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) moved to the west side
(not far from my house, actually) I spent the day helping him load and
unload the [U-Haul](http://www.uhaul.com/). Aside from being pretty
exhausting (and causing me to be sore and achey even today), it was good
to get all that done and I think it will be conducive to much gaming in
the coming times. I'm itchin' to get my [Soul
Calibur](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000935256/mhsvortex)
on.

 Saturday night after moving, we watched [*Mr. and Mrs.
Smith*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AP04FG/mhsvortex),
which I anticipated being the lamest thing ever but was actually quite
entertaining. Good humor and good action, just generally lots of fun.
Deep and meaningful? No, but that's not what we were looking for,
either. Just a lot of fun.

 Sunday was going to be a sort of "take it easy" day and was looking
like it would stay that way despite some minor chores in the morning,
but Jenn wanted to get the Christmas tree out of the attic, so that
created... a little tension. But I got it put up and, a reasonable
amount of grumbling and profanity aside, it all came together okay.

 Woke up this morning at 4:30a and couldn't go back to sleep, so at
5:00a I got up to read. Reading this book [*Sisters of the Raven* by
Barbara
Hambly](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446677043/mhsvortex).
It's pretty decent, though it's not one of those "can't put it down"
reads. I'm liking it, though, so I got up and spent an hour reading with
the cat before the alarm went off.

 Anyway, like I said - the juices are starting to flow again, which
hasn't happened for quite some time (the project we were on about this
time last year and into the beginning of this year was, shall we say,
*trying*) and I'm thinking about little projects and stuff to work on.
I'm working on a minor bug in
[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx),
and I think maybe there's some stuff I'd like to add to [Junction Shell
Extensions](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx). I also
want to get
[Solvent](/archive/2004/06/25/solvent-power-toys-for-visual-studio-.net.aspx)
working in VS 2005. Oh, and I want better blog software (that's been in
the works for a while now) so it might be time to buckle down and get
going on that. Plus the game bug has bitten me and I'd like to get back
into the gaming thing. So much to do, so little time.
