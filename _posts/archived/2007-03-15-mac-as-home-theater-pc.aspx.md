...and in a continued run on the home theater PC thread...

 [The Mac Mini HTPC site](http://www.machtpc.com) has some great entries
about a guy setting up a Mac Mini for his home theater. He's using
[distantDVD](http://www.distantdvd.com/index.php) as his front end,
allowing him to connect to any drive on the network - including Windows
shares - to get to movies. There's this odd "plays up to 950 movies"
restriction on it and it seems to be something systemic, like it can't
physically index more than that or something.

 There's even [a podcast about how to set up a Mac Mini based home
theater PC](http://www.htguys.com/archive/2007/March09.html). I may have
to look a little further down this avenue. You can get a Mac Mini for
like $600. That's something I could afford.
