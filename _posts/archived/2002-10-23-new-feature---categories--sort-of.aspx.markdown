I added a new feature to the ol' bloggeroo, here. If you look off to the
left in the navigation column, I've put two more links: "Reviews" and
"What If?"

 The Reviews link will (should) get you to my reviews of movies and
such. The What If? link should get you to my more random "What if the
world was like..." style articles. Like my [People
Pellets](/archive/2002/10/23/what-if--people-pellets.aspx) article.

 I'm hoping to make both of those sorts of items more frequently, so
I've added faster access to them.

 The crappy thing is, [Greymatter](http://noahgrey.com/greysoft/)
doesn't support categories. Yeah, I should probably shut up because it's
free and all, and I don't have access to a database, so I can't use
[Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) or anything, but regardless,
Greymatter doesn't support categories. What that means is that I
"categorize" my articles by the contents of the title: "Reviews"
articles start with "Review: " and "What If" articles start with "What
If?"

 What that further means is that I've exploited the search feature of
Greymatter to search for articles that contain that text, so if you get
improper results from the new links, that's probably why.

 If they don't work, let me know; I only tested this thing in IE6
because, well, that's what I use and I didn't want to install Netscape.
I used to have Netscape AND IE6 on the same box, but that machine
crashed a while ago, so... yeah.
