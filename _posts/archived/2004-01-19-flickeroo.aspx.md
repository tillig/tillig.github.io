I've been meaning to say something here about this travesty for a while,
but I've kept forgetting.

 There's this booger on the wall next to the sink in the men's restroom
here at work and it's been there for probably a couple months now. It
was there when I left for training in mid-December, and it's still
there. It's probably half a centimeter in diameter.

 I tried taking a picture of it (I was going to put a ruler next to it
so you could see how huge it is) but my camera doesn't do close-up very
well, so it was just a dark blur on the wall.

 I have only two questions about this. First, who was so unhygienic as
to *flick a fucking booger on the wall*? Second, *how come housekeeping
hasn't dealt with it*?!?!
