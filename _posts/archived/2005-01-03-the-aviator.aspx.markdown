Saw [*The Aviator*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338751/) this weekend,
the movie about [Howard
Hughes](http://www.socalhistory.org/Biographies/h_hughes.htm).
 
 The story takes you from Hughes's childhood through the flight of the
Spruce Goose ([which now resides in my home state of
Oregon](http://www.sprucegoose.org/)). I won't get too much into the
story, since it is a biopic, but it is a fascinating trip.
 
 I wasn't too hopeful considering I'm not a big [Leo
DiCaprio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/) fan, but Howard Hughes is
a very intriguing figure to me. By the end of the movie, DiCaprio *was*
Howard Hughes. Not to mention [Cate
Blanchett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/) does a great job as
[Katharine Hepburn](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000031/), and how can
you deny the draw of [Kate
Beckinsale](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000295/) as [Ava
Gardner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001257/)?
 
 The cool thing is, this movie was good from any standpoint you take:
historian, aviation fan, or drama lover. There's something for everyone
here. A great historic story, some wonderful airplane history and
information, and a beautiful story.
 
 The effects were also well done; seeing them build and fly the Spruce
Goose was almost like being there. I've never actually seen it in real
life; seeing as how it's local, I am now absolutely convinced I need to
visit.
 
 Check it out; this one's well worth the money to see, and with the size
of the plane Hughes built, how can you *not* see it on the big screen?
