Saw [*The Devil Wears Prada*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0458352/) on
Sunday. I had heard it was good from a couple of friends and I wasn't
disappointed.

 Normally I'm a summer blockbuster sucker. I saw [*Pirates of the
Caribbean*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/) and had a great time
with it. This was a fantastic break from overblown special effects and
computer imagery.

 [Anne Hathaway](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0004266/) (who is totally on
my list) plays Andrea, a new college graduate looking for a job in
journalism. She gets a job as the assistant for the ultra-demanding
editor-in-chief of a Cosmopolitan-style publication, played by [Meryl
Streep](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000658/).

 The movie plays out somewhat predictably, but that makes it no less
entertaining. Both Hathaway and Streep play their characters
wonderfully, and you soon overlook the predictable plot and care about
the characters regardless.

 The soundtrack is also pretty good. It's got a peppy, light, jazzy feel
to it that makes you feel sort of "summery." [I picked up a copy after
the show](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FZESR6/mhsvortex).

 A light, fun movie, it was the perfect distraction on a Sunday
afternoon. You don't have to see it on the big screen, but you won't
feel like you were cheated out of your matinee money if you do.
