No, I did not watch the *[Chronic-WHAT!-cles of
Narnia](http://www.hulu.com/watch/1397/saturday-night-live)*.

What I did, though, is accomplish quite a few things on long-running
projects and had quite a bit of time to relax, so big win on both
counts. I'm pretty goal-oriented so it's nice to check things off the
list of things to do, and yet, I'm also really lazy so "doing nothing"
is one of those things I like to check off.

Saturday was my day to accomplish stuff. The two items I got to check
off my list of ongoing crap:

1.  **I got my recliner fixed.** Jenn and I bought [some nice La-Z-Boy
    recliners](http://www.la-z-boy.com/furniture/product.aspx?pid=5162)
    for our game room upstairs. When they arrived, we noticed that one
    was really comfortable, but the other felt like you were sort of
    sitting in a hole on one side - you weren't sitting level, more at
    an angle or something. We had the repair people come out and look at
    it, and there was a piece that wasn't stapled down right so they
    fixed that. I sat in it, though, and it still didn't feel right. I
    had some other people come over and try it, too, just to make sure I
    wasn't being all "Princess and the Pea" with it and, sure enough, it
    wasn't just me. The repair folks came back on Saturday and added
    some padding on the low side to reinforce the seat. Now it feels
    great! One less thing to worry about.
2.  **I figured out how to play iTunes music through Windows Media
    Center.** I'll actually post a separate blog article on this later,
    but I figured out how to get Apple Lossless and AAC music playing
    through Windows Media Center just like MP3 files, and it didn't
    require me to buy/install anything like MCETunes. Music was not my
    primary goal with [my Media Center
    solution](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx),
    but getting it to work makes me feel good.

Saturday night I had my friends Jason and Torin over to play some games.
We originally planned on busting out some *[Colossal
Arena](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105)* but somehow we ended
up playing
*[Left4Dead](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QY9C90?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000QY9C90)*
for like four hours. Good times - even Jenn joined in on the zombie
destruction.

Sunday was truly lazy and relaxing. Jenn and I took a bike ride to the
Starbucks in downtown Hillsboro where I sucked down a giant Frappuccino,
thereby negating any good the bike ride would have done. We watched some
movies, had a little lunch, then around 4:00p Jason and I reconvened
online for some more zombie mayhem. I rounded off the night with a very
tasty barbecue meal Jenn made. Good times.
