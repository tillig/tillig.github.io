It was a three-day weekend for Jenn and I this past Memorial Day
weekend, so let's see how we fared...

Saturday we ran around and did errands. The big Saturday errand was that
I moved off the corporate cell phone plan and onto a family plan with
Jenn on [Verizon Wireless](http://www.verizonwireless.com). I was tired
of carrying a phone and a PDA (and an iPod, and all the other junk in my
pockets) so I got a [BlackBerry Curve](http://www.blackberrycurve.com/)
to at least consolidate the phone and PDA into one device. So far I like
it quite a bit, but it's definitely taking some getting used to, and
setting it up for personal use is not nearly documented so well as
setting it up for enterprise use. When I get all of the kinks worked
out, I'll blog my recommendations.

Sunday I met up with a friend of mine who I hadn't seen in probably five
years. He was down from Seattle with his family and it was great to
catch up. There was a bit of a scheduling problem getting on the same
page as to when we were meeting up, resulting in Jenn and I stuck in a
holding pattern at home, trying to connect but not really able to start
anything or go anywhere lest we miss the connection. Hopefully we'll be
able to iron that out a little better for next time. He did come bearing
gifts, though: autographed [Bruce
Campbell](http://www.bruce-campbell.com/) books. Can't beat that!

Monday morning we did all the stuff around the house that we didn't fit
in on Sunday and then joined up with some of our friends for
dinner, gaming, and a movie at their place. We played some ping pong
(which included in-play hazards in the form of their cat attacking the
ball) and [Ticket to Ride
Europe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000809OAO?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000809OAO),
then watched *[National Treasure
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BM63O?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0013BM63O)*.
Not really sure if *NT2* was good or not because there was a lot going
on... and for the first third or so of the movie the aspect ratio on the
TV was messed up and gave me a headache so I couldn't really watch.
Regardless, good times.

This morning I am ridiculously exhausted. I slept like crap and I'm way
behind on my current project due to some unforeseen meetings and things.
Muscling through, but I gotta say I could really use a nap.
