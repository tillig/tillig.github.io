I was very bad just now.
 
 I'm really not in a position to be buying anything, but after writing
up my diatribe on wondering what ever happened to The Shamen and Pop
Will Eat Itself, I went searching around and came up with a place called
the [Global Electronic Music Marketplace](http://www.gemm.com). It's
sort of like [half.com](http://www.half.com) where sellers from all over
can unite in one big marketplace, but the beauty of GEMM is that it
focuses *specifically* on the music part of things. I did a couple of
cursory searches and found *so many things I wanted* that I couldn't
contain myself. I ended up buying a couple of PWEI CD singles that I've
been looking for *forever* and a couple of 12" vinyl singles for stuff I
didn't even know existed but really hoped did. (I'll convert those to CD
later.)
 
 Maybe now I should start looking at DJ turntables.
 
 Maybe I should just quit while I'm ahead.
