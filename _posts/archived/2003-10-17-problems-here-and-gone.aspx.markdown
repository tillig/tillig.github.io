I noticed for the last couple of days that my DNS forwarding from
[www.paraesthesia.com](/) to paraesthesia.mildperil.net was on the
fritz. Not sure why, but it's back now. That's a Good Thing, because I
didn't want to have to fight the powers and move my DNS forwarding to
someone else. What a pain.

 My POP3 mail is back online, so I'm able to use Outlook Express instead
of stupid webmail, and I'm mega-pleased about that. Took long enough.

 My demo project at work is coming along well. I think I'm beating the
expectations, which I try to do, and which I think people appreciate.
I'm working off a 24 page spec document (each page has a screen shot of
what they want), and I'm on page 23. Of course, page 24 is a bulleted
list of things they didn't have time to mock up screen shots for...

 I'm getting [HDTV from
Comcast](http://www.comcast.com/Benefits/CableDetails/Slot4PageOne.asp)
this weekend. Tomorrow morning the cable guy should be at my place to
swap me cable boxes and provide my gateway to the world of the HD.
Looking forward to that. High-definition
[*Alias*](http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/index.html), here I come!

 Apple finally released [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) for
Windows, and I couldn't be more pleased. I was using
[ephPod](http://www.ephpod.com/) (because Musicmatch Jukebox is a hunk
of shit) and ephPod was giving me errors and refusing to sync my stuff.
iTunes works perfectly (so far) and - best of all - it's free. I'm
digging it. At some point, I may even buy stuff from the Apple Music
store.
