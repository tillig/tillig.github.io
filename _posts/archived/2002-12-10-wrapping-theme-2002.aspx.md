Every year I try to be creative in my Christmas gift wrapping efforts.
Usually I'll try and go for a theme, so that all the gifts under the
tree from me are distinctive.

 I've done movies (wrapped the packages in movie posters and used old
film as the bows), generic (brown paper only), and high security
(entirely wrapped in a layer of duct tape) to name a few.

 This year I was having a difficult time figuring out what to go with. I
ended up choosing a variation on a previously mentioned theme:
**Authentic Postal**.

 Every gift will be wrapped in postal-standard brown paper. They will be
sealed to postal standards using brown postal tape. The contents of
every gift will be wrapped in bubble wrap for protection, and each
package will be labeled with an authentic-looking UPS-style tracking
label, printed up on the local laser printer.

 I'm stoked. I think I'm going to start wrapping stuff tonight when I
get home.
