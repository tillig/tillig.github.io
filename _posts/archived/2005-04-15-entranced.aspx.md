I went to the store last night and picked up [*Best of Trance, Vol.
5*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007KTB5I/mhsvortex)
because, well, I dig the whole trance music thing.

 It did bring up an interesting thought, though, as I was ripping it
onto my iPod: I have my music classified by genre (as do most of you
iTunes users out there) and I'm finding that it's really hard to
[classify electronic
music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music#Genres). I mean,
like, trance, dance, techno, house, drum and bass...

 I look at the way I have things in the ol' iTunes library, and I'm
irritated with the inconsistency. I can see why the default iTunes
classification is "Electronica/Dance."

 After I finish putting the album art into all of my tracks, I guess
I'll have to go back and reclassify.
