Added support for "obsolete" tag.

Added support for use of "style" and "align" attribute on "para" and
"note" tags.

Fixed issue where code and other text containing encoded XML entities
would not properly render.

Fixed placeholder support for "include" tag at top level of
documentation.

Added language word expansions when using "\<see langword="\*" /\>"
