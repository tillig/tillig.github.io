I'm just coming across way too many cool things while cruising the
morning news, so I'm going to share in a sort of random tech news
aggregation thing.
 
 First, it looks like Mark Miller's introducing some cool stuff for the
next version of CodeRush - [Dynamic templates sound pretty
awesome.](http://www.doitwith.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4a3f77b5-f178-463b-b08b-835df6dd46e5)
I can't wait for that.
 
 Next, there's an entry on the PowerShell blog discussing [the grammar
of the Windows
PowerShell](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/05/10/594535.aspx).
The geek in me smiles while the rest of you look on in disgust.
 
 Moving on to gaming, it looks like the stupid bat-a-rang controller for
the PS3 is no more. [Sony has released the *real* new PS3
controller.](http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/08/sony-shows-off-the-real-ps3-controller/)
Looks a lot like the standard PS2 "Dual Shock 2" controller, but runs on
Bluetooth and can detect motion (sort of like [the Nintendo "Wii"
controller](http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/10/nintendos-final-wii-controller-what-we-know/)).
Of course, the new PS3 controller doesn't have any vibration feature the
way the other controllers do because it apparently messes up the motion
detection. Hmmm. I guess that wasn't the hugest part of gaming, but it
did add a little something.
 
 For folks that aren't into that crazy Wii controller, I guess there
will be [a "Classic controller" that you can
use.](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/wii-classic-controller-172694.php)
Just watch - you'll have to have both controller types because some
games won't work with one.
 
 Oh, and [the Halo 3 trailer is
out](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/events/e32006/articles/halo3.htm),
so check it. It rocks. (My dad actually sent this to me before I got to
it. Dad is *stoked* and he doesn't even own a single game console. I
think he's just found his reason to get an Xbox 360.)
 
 Okay, I think that's it. For now.
