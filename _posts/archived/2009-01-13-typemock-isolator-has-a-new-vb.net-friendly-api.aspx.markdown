Typemock Isolator 5.2 is out, and they've updated their mocking API to
be more Visual Basic friendly. If you're quick about it, you may even be
able to procure yourself a free personal license.

Actually, they already have a pretty good blurb on it, so why don't I
just let them say it?

I already have a license, so I won't be submitting my entry, but if you
don't have one, now's a great opportunity to get Typemock Isolator for
free.
