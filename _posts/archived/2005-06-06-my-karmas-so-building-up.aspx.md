Okay, so we all know that [my 300 pound carpet weight is coming back on
Tuesday](/archive/2005/06/03/the-end-is-near.aspx) and there's not a
damn thing I can do about that. (I'm going to try talking to
[Magnolia](http://www.magnoliahifi.com/), where I bought it, but I'm
doing my best to just [move from the depression stage into
acceptance](http://www.counselingforloss.com/article8.htm).)

 I went this weekend to rent a couple of movies down at [Mr. Hygiene's
video store](/archive/2005/04/20/mr.-hygiene.aspx) where I have the
monthly video pass - I can have two movies out at a time for however
long I want and I can rent as many movies I want in the month. The pass
is good only for that specific location, even though the rental chain is
country-wide. Fine. I got a note in the mail a week or so ago
(conveniently like a day before they renewed my membership for the
month) telling me the price of the monthly pass was going up. I was
willing to accept that - it's not a budget-breaker by any means, it's
just annoying.

 Anyway, I went to rent a couple of movies and it turns out the location
I rent at is closing. Today (Monday) is the last day for rentals and
they're transferring my membership "automatically" to their sister
location a few miles down the road.

 That's a problem. The shop we were renting at was just on the edge of
convenient as far as location. Moving my account for me to the next
closest location a few additional miles down the road doesn't help
things. If it weren't for the fact that they don't refund partial
months' account fees, I'd go down there and cancel right now. Thing is,
I rented two movies for $25 this month and I don't feel that I've
gotten my money's worth. I'll probably cancel anyway and just eat the
$25.

 From a karma standpoint, I must be getting ready for one hell of a
second half to this year. This first half has sucked.
