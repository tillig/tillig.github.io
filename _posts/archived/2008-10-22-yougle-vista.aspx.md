I have been considering ways to add to my Vista Media Center experience
and one of the things I'm interested in doing is adding YouTube and
other online media sources so I don't have to hop into a browser to see
them. I haven't tried it yet, but I came across [Yougle
Vista](http://push-a-button.com/products/youglevista/) - a plugin for
Windows Vista Media Center to integrate YouTube, Flickr, Apple Trailers,
and several other online media sources right into the interface. Might
have to try that out.
