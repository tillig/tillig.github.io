The television repairman, Jon, [fixed my
TV](/archive/2005/01/31/television-nightmare.aspx) today around 11:30a
or so. The problem I was seeing was some color distortion in the bottom
corners of the set. It looked like some sort of magnetic disturbance,
but there was nothing near that area of the case, so I couldn't figure
it out.
 
 Jon said he's seen this a lot. The deal is, the tube in my TV (being a
40" tube) is large enough to be affected by geomagnetic forces (i.e.,
the [North Magnetic
Pole](http://www.geolab.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/northpole_e.shtml)). Which
means if you place it, it gets used to facing a particular direction and
the forces in a particular location. When we moved to the new place, the
moving process, coupled with the fact that the TV isn't oriented
precisely the direction it used to be, caused the "purity" (as Jon calls
it) to go out of alignment.
 
 Jon did the "purity alignment" by silicone gluing some small magnets to
the tube. It was a trial-and-error process, and you can't get it 100%
perfect, but it's fixed enough now that you don't see any distortion in
the picture.
 
 I would never have conceived that the *Earth's magnetism* would *affect
my TV*. Definitely not something they tell you in the store.
 
 He told me lots of interesting things about TVs and such. For example,
DLP (digital light processing) TVs on the assembly line can be
aligned/configured via a computer-driven sensor array in about 10 - 15
seconds. My TV, being a large tube, must be aligned by a human, and each
human only gets about 30 seconds to do that alignment. He also told me
that manufacturers are moving away from CRT (tube) TVs and toward LCD
and DLP (rear-projection) TVs. Finally, he recommended looking at the
[Samsung DLP
TVs](http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_subtype.jsp?eUser=&prod_path=%2fAudio+and+Video%2fTV%2fDLP+TV),
particularly [their 50"
model](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002MLXA2/mhsvortex), as
those offer the most bang for your buck (they use the same internal
components as the Mitsubishi TVs but have less troubles and are, in some
cases, consumer-serivceable).
 
 Not that I want to be buying a new TV in the near future, but if and
when the time comes, I'll have to give those a look.
