Is there a tech geek out there *without* a podcast? First
[Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/), now
[Millahseconds](http://www.millahseconds.com/). Maybe I should come up
with a podcast produced by [Carl
Franklin](http://www.intellectualhedonism.com/) that also makes a
time-based wordplay.
