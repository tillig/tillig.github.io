I think I just found my new favorite online store: [United
Nuclear](http://www.unitednuclear.com/). Among the stuff you can buy...

-   [Uranium](http://www.unitednuclear.com/uranium.htm)
-   [Aerogel (world's lowest density
    solid)](http://www.unitednuclear.com/aerogel.htm)
-   [MagnaView liquid (10nm magnets in a liquid
    suspension)](http://www.unitednuclear.com/magnets.htm)
-   [N45 grade neodymium
    magnets](http://www.unitednuclear.com/magnets.htm) (so strong you
    have to [sign a
    disclaimer](http://www.unitednuclear.com/disclaimer.htm) before you
    can buy them because two together can crush your finger)


 How can you *not* shop there?
