It's been a while since I touched these, particularly since I don't use
NAnt much anymore, but I got spurred into action by one of my readers
(thanks Mark!). To that end, I did some updating to get things to work
with a more recent environment...

- Updated to .NET 2.0.
- Updated to NAnt 0.86 beta 1.
- Fixed nunitexec task to no longer output the "framework" parameter.
- Fixed nunitexec task to properly quote only the value of
    command-line parameters.
- Fixed alpharesx to output .resx files in 2.0 schema format.

[Go get
it!](/archive/2007/01/29/paraesthesia.tools.nanttasks-custom-nant-tasks.aspx)
