Just got a call from this guy Bill over at Farmer's Insurance. I'll take
my car in to the body shop for the estimate tomorrow morning, then take
the car back this coming Monday for the final work to begin on it. I'll
get a rental car Monday so I can get to work. (Yay?)

 Well, this is all coming together. Hopefully my car will be done for
Christmas.
