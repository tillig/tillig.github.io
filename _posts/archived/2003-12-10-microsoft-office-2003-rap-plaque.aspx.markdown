I'm sure you all remember the SharePoint Portal Server work that I was
doing for several months in a row just a little bit ago. Well, that was
part of the "Rapid Adoption Program" for Microsoft Office 2003. Today,
in the mail, I got a plaque for my efforts:
 
 ![Office 2003 RAP
Plaque](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pY3tq1yijUPFV1z8k01NKT1pUI1ckxgbTz01W0qO7GIcl3ERcflRwrqBnVzHP7rhB-zUvQ7F1nWqF3mdHTvc9p8WrUFwJfJBWnI4HnNEpqiQ/20031210plaque.jpg?psid=1)

 
 It says:
 
 *Microsoft Office
 Worldwide Office System Rapid Adoption Program
 Thank you for your outstanding contribution*
 
 I'm sure they printed like a million of these things, but I don't care.
Normally my reward for putting up with shit is... more shit. This time I
got a plaque. (I'm still dealing with Portal Server, but the difference
here is the recognition that I'm doing it.) I think that's pretty cool.
 
 (Oh, and it's actually rectangular; it's just the camera I used to take
the picture has a bit of a fisheye to it.)
