The next-door neighbor's sprinkler system either needs some serious
adjusting or he has a broken pipe because every time his sprinkler runs
he floods out like a quarter of my back yard. I'm talking standing water
an inch or two deep style, here.

 Of course, the guy's never home so he doesn't notice.

 I went over there this weekend to mention it to him but, as usual, he
wasn't home. I left a note and decided to hope for the best.

 Later that day he must have come home because he left a note for us on
our door. He confirmed that he's not home too much, but he said he'd get
it fixed in a couple of days.

 So, now I wait. I'm glad it was reasonably amicable and I'm hoping to
keep it that way. I'll give him a week and see if it hasn't been fixed
by then. In the meantime, maybe I should get some swamp grass to plant
along the fence line.
