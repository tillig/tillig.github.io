After my dealings with the user yesterday and my general attitude
towards things anyway, I drummed up some more shirts and goodies for
folks to buy at my [Junk
Store](http://www.cafeshops.com/paraesthesia,like_to_help_01,hate_people_01).
Now I offer shirts to help frustrated people like me show how they feel
towards the user community. New offerings include the phrases "I Hate
People" and "I'd like to help you, but not as much as I'd like not to."

 I went to lunch at an all-you-can-eat Indian joint with my friend Aaron
today. Now I'm burping this sort of off-flavor lamb curry substance.
This stuff always comes back to get me. Tasty going down, harsh later
on.
 
 Microsoft finally got back to me regarding the memory leak support case
I filed like seven months ago. I've now followed their suggestions to
fix the issue and I'm running tests to see if it worked. So far? It
still looks broken to me.
 
 I've watched the new [*American Idol*](http://www.idolonfox.com/) the
past couple of nights and so far I'm pleased with how it's turning out.
I scream and cringe when the worst of the worst show up to audition, and
I'm happy when they finally find someone halfway decent. I guess I'll
continue following it, at least until they eliminate all the people I
like.
 
 On the [*American Idol* home page](http://www.idolonfox.com/home.htm)
they have a contest where you can win a walk-on role in the upcoming
Kelly Clarkson/Justin Guarini movie. I entered, you should too.
