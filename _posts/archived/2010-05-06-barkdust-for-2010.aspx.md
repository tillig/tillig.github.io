It was once again time for new barkdust, so, [just as we did a couple of
years back](/archive/2008/10/03/barkdust-put-in-yesterday.aspx), we
called [Grimm's Advanced Bark
Blowing](http://www.grimmsfuel.com/blower.htm) and got our one unit of
medium fresh fir. It was still $295, just as it was two years ago, so
it was nice to see the prices didn't go up. Flowerbeds are looking nice
again. Now we just have to go out and dig out the sprinkler heads since
they're buried in... barkdust.
