Yesterday I finally finished ripping [all of the DVDs I
own](http://www.invelos.com/dvdcollection.aspx/tillig) to date. I didn't
rip discs with only special features on them and I skipped a few that I
didn't think we'd be watching again.

All told, I have **770 VIDEO_TS folders taking up 4.91TB** of space on
my Windows Home Server. That's about 6.7GB per disc image.

If you want to know more about my Media Center solution - what I was
trying to accomplish, why I chose VIDEO_TS instead of MPEG or some
other compressed format, etc. - check out [the overview of my Media
Center
solution](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx).
