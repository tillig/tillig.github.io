At the recommendation of a co-worker, I purchased the
[TestKing](http://www.testking.com) practice test questions. According
to him, the questions he had on his test were darn close - if not
identical - to the ones on the TestKing exam.

 After reading through most of them, I've come to the conclusion that
the self test questions from [Self Test
Software](http://www.selftestsoftware.com) are almost identical to
TestKing's questions, so it's all the same. I like the TestKing
explanations better than Self Test Software's, but for $40 extra, I may
not do TestKing for the next one. I guess it all depends on how I do.

 Regardless, I took a "certification readiness" practice test, which
means they don't tell you your score until the end and you are under a
time limit, and I finished an hour early with an 80% (which, I think, is
a passing score on the real thing). And since I've done that, and I'm
looking over the TestKing questions and feeling pretty confident and
comfortable with them, I did it.

 I bit the bullet and scheduled the exam.

 I'll go in for my attempt (and hopefully pass) on Monday, July 28, at
9:00a. I figured, take this weekend to really study my ass off, then
with all the info fresh in my mind, go in early Monday morning, do a
last minute quick-review, and hopefully pass. At $125 a whack, I'm
hoping not to have to make a second try. My hands were shaking with the
adrenaline as I scheduled it. I mean, that was just the *scheduling* of
the test. I can only imagine how I'm going to be the morning of the test
itself. But I'm feeling good about it now that I've seen the TestKing
stuff and got the decent score on the "certification readiness" test.

 They said on the "certification readiness" test that 80% was a fail.
Considering the other stuff I've seen from that practice test software,
anything less than 100% is fail, too, so I don't think I'm doing that
bad.

 So... here goes. Send good luck vibes my way. If I can pass this test,
then I only have four more to pass and I get my certification. I haven't
planned that far yet, but it's coming, so any help I can get, I'm
taking.
