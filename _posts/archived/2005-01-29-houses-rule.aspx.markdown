I [bought my first house this
year](/archive/2004/03/29/funded-and-recorded.aspx) and it sorta drained
the funds a bit. We've recovered (financially speaking) for the most
part, but I've still got stuff like the "no interest/no payments" thing
on our washer and dryer hanging over me and that has to be paid... we're
not quite back to where we were.
 
 And then I did my taxes.
 
 I've had to *pay* for the last three years. I mean, just bend me over.
This year, I'm getting a *refund*. ***A refund***. Enough to pay off
that washer and dryer and maybe get a new dishwasher because the one we
have sucks donkey.
 
 *A refund, I tell you!* I'm stoked.
