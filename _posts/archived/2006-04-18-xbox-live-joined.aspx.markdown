I joined [Xbox Live](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/) since the Silver
membership is free and they give you a free month of the Gold
membership, just to try it out. Added my
[gamercard](http://live.xbox.com/member/Paraesthesia) to the site over
in the navigation section, and I even already have [a
Friend](http://live.xbox.com/member/jbat1). I realize I'm like a week
late and several dollars short on this, but I have to hand it to
Microsoft - they did a pretty snazzy job getting the network thing set
up. I don't anticipate I'll be entering into any online tournaments, but
just so I can play against folks I know I'll probably chip in the \$50 a
year for the Gold.
 
 I noticed that Xbox 360 shows your wireless controller battery level on
the dashboard and mine's already getting low. It's looking like you can
get about 12 hours or so of play from a set of double-A batteries. (I
haven't actually run out of juice yet, but given the rate it's going,
that's the amount of time I'm guessing I have.) As such, I cashed in
some gift certificates that have been piling up and got [the quick
charge
kit](http://videogames.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?EAN=2000003109937&x=28201804),
a second [rechargeable
battery](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6MLSC/mhsvortex)
(the charge kit comes with one), and, while I was at it, [*Tomb Raider:
Legend*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000A0XSN6/mhsvortex).
That should be here shortly. In the meantime, I'll probably have to pop
some new batteries in so I can continue riding the walls around the
track in [*Project Gotham Racing
3*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6ML28/mhsvortex). (I
totally suck at that game. I think I might have beaten one or two things
on "normal" mode, but the rest? Easy mode, baby.)
 
 I [joined Jenn up to Xbox Live](http://live.xbox.com/member/Jennlady),
too, at the Silver level, so she can go buy little games and stuff from
the Xbox Live Marketplace. She's addicted to those damn [Pop Cap
games](http://www.popcap.com/), and what better way to play them than in
high definition, right?
