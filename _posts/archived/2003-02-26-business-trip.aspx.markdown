In the splendour of my laziness last night, I deemed it a good idea to
throw half a bag of [Ore-Ida Onion
Rings](http://www.oreida.com/onions.jsp) into the oven and just eat that
for dinner.
 
 I've had better ideas.
 
 Along with my onion rings, I thought I'd sit down with the
[Chinotto](/archive/2003/02/24/chinotto.aspx) I had in the fridge and
eat up while watching *Buffy*. A couple of sips into it, I went back
into the kitchen to do a little mixing.
 
 Chinotto is much better with a hefty dose of coconut rum in it.
 
 [*Buffy*](http://www.buffy.com) was a good episode, with good humor. I
like that.
 
 This morning I got in to work and found that there's a [Microsoft
SharePoint Technologies Developers'
Conference](http://www.dynamicevents.com/SharePointPTDevCon.htm) going
on. Being a Microsoft Partner company, we got a special invite to this
thing. It runs April 14 - 18 in Redmond, WA at the Microsoft Campus.
 
 I'm all signed up and set to go.
 
 This is my first business trip out of the local area. I mean, I've been
to training a couple of times, but always at a local facility.
Conferences, same thing. I've never been out of town for a business
trip. Frankly, I'm kind of scared.
 
 See, I have this *comfort zone*, if you will, which surrounds me with
familiarity. I'm not a very social person (you'd never have guessed,
right?), so this is a big step for me. An out-of-town trip, by myself,
for a *week*. Yow.
 
 I suppose I'll get by all right. I always have in the past with new
stuff. It's a little stressful, but I'll figure it out. Plus, my boss
might be going, too, which would make it a little better.
 
 Needless to say, I did not sign up to go to the "group dinner" or any
of the other "mingle and network" events. I hate mingling, and the only
networking I do happens in a server room. I guess we'll see how that
goes.
