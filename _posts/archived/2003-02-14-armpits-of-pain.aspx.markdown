Due to our tendency to atrophy rather than move, Jenn and I have
searched long and hard to find a workout solution that not only provides
the activity we need, but does so in a fun way that isn't the lame
repetition of lifting weights or riding an exercise bike.
 
 To that end we have gotten a couple of those [large inflatable yoga
balls](http://www.gaiam.com/retail/category.asp?catalog%5Fname=gai&category%5Fname=l2%5FBalanceBall).
 
 (This may sound familiar; [I wrote about it before
once.](/archive/2003/01/14/memory-leak.aspx))
 
 Anyway, we got a lower body workout video and an upper body workout
video (Jenn picked 'em out; apparently they don't have a single workout
that does the whole thing... I suppose you could play them back-to-back,
though, and call it a day). We did the lower body workout and I had no
issues. It didn't seem too difficult or anything. Then we did the upper
body workout.
 
 My armpits are killing me. And that was two days ago.
 
 I'm not sure if the pain is in, like, my pecs, or what, but whatever
muscle it is that's in your armpit, that's what's hurting.
 
 It's not like a bad pain; it's an "I'm a big pussy and finally
exercised" pain. I assume if I did this sort of thing enough I'd get
used to it and actually strengthen up. That's the point, isn't it? I'll
keep at it and see what happens.
 
 If we really like it, I think I'll get the [DVD
version](http://www.gaiam.com/retail/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=gai&category%5Fname=l2%5FBalanceBall&product%5Fid=91%2D0196)
that has all of the workouts on one disc. That'll save time rewinding,
too.
 
 The only real problem I have with it is the way the instructor lady is
all *new-agey* and shit. It sort of irritates me that she's telling me
to do stuff like "create space within myself" - what the hell is that
supposed to mean? I suppose when you're doing yoga stuff that's to be
expected. I guess I'll just ignore it.
