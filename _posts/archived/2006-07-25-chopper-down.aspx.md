I took [the RC helicopter](/archive/2006/07/24/caketastic-30th.aspx) out
last night to adjust it a little more and get my practice on. There was
just the slightest bit of wind, but for the most part, it was a clear
night and I really wanted to get it going.

 I flew several shorter flights, trying to fine-tune this little
potentiometer on it to get the thing to stop tail-spinning. I think I
had it, too. Took it up for a bit, got it under a reasonable amount of
control (very mild spinning, probably more me just over-correcting) and
was bringing it down when this tree in my front yard violently attacked
the helicopter, bringing it crashing down.

 Either that, or maybe I sort of flew into the branches there... you
choose. My vote is for the [Whomping
Willow](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/hogwarts/castle/willow.html) version.

 Anyway, that wasn't the first time I had hit the tree, but it survived
all the other times. Not this time. This time this little bar that
balances out the helicopter's main rotor broke cleanly in half, bringing
my flight to an end. Just when I was getting good, too! (Jenn can attest
to the fact it was flying with some mild amount of control.)

 So now I have to go searching for replacement parts. The owner's manual
says you can get them, I'm just not sure where. ("Items to be purchased
are lined below. You can order them by their item name, purchase them
from local distributors." The owner's manual is in
[Engrish](http://www.engrish.com/). I think my favorite is the warning
about flying in wind - "Do not fly in strong winds. It can limit the
helicopter's fly and confuse your control. Flying in strong winds. The
chopper will be missing or cause damage.")

 Time for a Google search.
