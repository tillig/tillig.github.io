My [Wonka jacket from
Redballs](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2005/08/29/wonka-jacket-possibility-back-open.aspx)
arrived yesterday in size 2XL and it fits perfectly, so that part of the
costume is now nailed down. I'll take it in to the dry cleaners tonight
to get it cleaned and pressed (it arrived folded in a box, so it's got
creases from that; it just needs to be freshened up a bit). If you're in
the market, check [Redballs](http://www.redballs.com/) out - they really
rock, and the service is awesome. Any question, just email 'em and they
will totally hook you up. Just note that the sizes, at least in the
Wonka coat, run a little small - I normally fit nicely into an XL, but
the 2XL is what I wear in the Wonka, and it's still just *ever so
slightly* tight in the shoulders (not enough to worry about, but I
thought I'd mention it).
 
 That gets that part of the costume out of the way. I also verified that
my suit pants still fit (yay!), so the pants are taken care of. That
leaves the vest, which I've been looking at the pattern for and will
probably commence work on tonight. Once that's done, I'll have it all
taken care of.
 
 This is going to be *so cool*.

**UPDATE 10/02/05**: The costume came out well. [Here are the
details.](/archive/2005/10/02/wonka-costume-complete.aspx)
