I've been reading documents here and there recently and have run up
against something that seems to be confusing to some authors: when and
how to use bullet point lists.

For those who are unaware, here's the shocking rule of thumb for using
bullet point lists: **If you have a list of things, you can use bullet
points** (or numbers, as appropriate). **If it's just a paragraph of
prose describing something, it's not a bullet point list.**

For example, say you're describing the process by which you take out the
trash. **This is not a good bullet point list:**

- I go in the kitchen and pull out the garbage can.
- Sometimes the garbage stinks a little because of the food in there.
- Other times it doesn't stink, but it's OK because there's air
    freshener in the room next door.
- I might go get the air freshener, but not yet.
- I pull the garbage bag out of the trash can and walk it outside.
    Then I stick it in the large trash can outside.
- Now I might get the air freshener.

Again, that's not a good bullet point list. It's a series of sentences
that, with some help, would make a prose paragraph describing the trash
removal process. Bullet point items should be self-contained. They
should generally be short and to the point - again, it's a list, not a
story in bullet form. That crap about the garbage stinking in the above
list - what's that doing there? Why is the thing written like a story?
No, no, no. That's just... painful.

**A decent bullet list is more like this**:

- Go in kitchen.
- Pull out garbage can.
- Get bag out of garbage can.
- Take bag outside and place in large can.
- If necessary, spray air freshener in the kitchen.

Short, to the point. A list of self-contained thoughts.

Another use of bullets might be in denoting section breaks in short,
self-contained text blocks. Like a question/answer thing:

- **Question**: Where is the garbage can?
     **Answer**: In the kitchen.
- **Question**: Where do I take the garbage bag?
     **Answer**: To the large can outside.

Here you see the individual thoughts outlined by the bullets, while
slightly longer, are still fairly self-contained. I also added a little
white space between each item to help that visual delineation of
thoughts. I didn't write an essay and throw a bullet in front of it. I
didn't take a story and make each sentence in the story into a bullet
item.

It's okay if you'd rather describe things in a prose paragraph or three.
Bullets have their uses and maybe the thought isn't conducive to the
bullet treatment. That said, **bullets don't necessarily make your
thoughts more intelligible. Use them where appropriate.** When in doubt,
maybe err on the side of not using bullets. I mean, **if you don't know
if it's a bullet list or not... it's probably not**.

*Note: This is particularly applicable to the folks who think Excel is a
word processor. It's not. Just stop. Now. Seriously.*
