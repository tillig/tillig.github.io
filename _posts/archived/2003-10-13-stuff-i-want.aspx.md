Found some stuff I want...

 [Remote controlled Acura
RSX](http://www.radioshack.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=CTLG&category%5Fname=CTLG%5F006%5F005%5F002%5F001&product%5Fid=60%2D4342)
from Radio Shack. Just like what I drive, except mine's black and
doesn't look like a rice racer.

 [Light gun games](http://www.ps2home.co.uk/ps2_light_gun_games.htm),
many of which aren't available in the US. The Police 24/7 one looks
especially cool, but isn't over here yet. I'm hoping it'll show up
soon.
