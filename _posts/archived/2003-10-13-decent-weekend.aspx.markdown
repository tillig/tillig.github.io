This was the first truly decent weekend I've had in a while. I'm not
ridiculously tired this morning and I don't feel like I wasted my time.
What made it better? In no particular (or chronological) order...
 
 We quit Atkins. After a week and a half and eleven pounds lost, we
quit. I've been known to say, "If someone said I could never have
chocolate again, I'd be fine. But if someone said I couldn't have bread,
I'd want to kill myself." I think I proved that I was right - it was the
lack of bread that made me hate everything and everyone. Now that I've
had a *bun* on a burger, I'm doing *much better*.
 
 I've decided to get a new computer. I'm going to get a pretty decent
deal on a P4 2.66GHz machine through one of the myriad employee purchase
programs that we've got set up at work, and it's about time. I'm tired
of fighting my computer to go, and the boot up time is ridiculous.
 
 I got time to work on my [Halloween
costume](http://www.simplicity.com/designFrame.cfm?designId=8170&design=5386).
I'm going to be a Grammaton Cleric from the movie
[*Equilibrium*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLWN/mhsvortex)
(which looks a lot like Neo from [*The
Matrix*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K19E/mhsvortex),
but is much cooler). I've got it about halfway done, and I'm actually
enjoying the sewing of it quite a bit. There's something about making
something tangible (as opposed to, say, computer code, which is vastly
intangible) and having something to show for your work that is extremely
rewarding to me.
 
 I played a *load* of *Time Crisis 2*. I really dig the light gun
shooting thing, and this is a damn fun game. Hell yeah.
 
 I bought a few movies at Costco. I got the 1963 edition of [*The
Italian
Job*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AUHPB/mhsvortex) for
\$12.99. I also got a two-pack of movies for \$20:
[*Payback*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JDIQ/mhsvortex)
and
[*Face/Off*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/630512762X/mhsvortex).
And the two-pack has a \$10 off coupon for the [Indiana Jones
Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXC5/mhsvortex)
coming out on the 21st. So, basically, I got two movies for \$5 each.
Not bad.
 
 That's about it. It doesn't sound like a lot got accomplished, but the
relaxing part of the weekend was nice. I'm hoping to continue that into
this week, finishing up my costume (which I can see will potentially
become very frustrating as I near the end) and watching some of my new
movies.
