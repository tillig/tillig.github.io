It's been pretty stressful at work, so I took this weekend to play.
 
 Friday night Jenn and I went to the [Winter
Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) game. They only really "showed up" in
the final ten minutes of the game, so I was a little bored and, frankly,
pissed off until then, but they ended up winning 3-0 (yeah, *scoreless*
until the last ten minutes) so it wasn't too terrible. Plus we got to
see a bunch of friends of ours that we don't normally see, so that was
good.
 
 Saturday is usually chores with some gaming thrown in, but like I said,
it was playtime. [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), Tif, Jenn, and I
headed out to play laser tag for a bit, which we totally kicked ass at.
(Considering the competition averaged about 12 years old, not terribly
surprising, but a couple of them were *animals*.) Played a couple of
games of that and felt we got our exercise for the day.
 
 We followed that up by a trip to the movies to see
[*UltraViolet*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/). Ugh. [I reviewed
that earlier](/archive/2006/03/06/ultraviolet.aspx), but the quick
answer is: skip it. Looks beautiful, sucks donkey. Dammit.
 
 Jenn and I rounded off the night by a trip to the Corillian "Casino
Night" event. I didn't anticipate too much about this one, but it turned
out to be a total blast. Talked to some folks from work that I don't
normally talk to and hung out much of the night with [Chris and
Julie](http://www.chrisbrooks.org/), Chris teaching Julie, Jenn, and me
how to play craps (much more fun than I thought). Neither Jenn nor I won
anything, and we both lost our "money," but it was awesome and we'll
definitely make the next one. Hopefully we can convince Stu and Tiff to
go as well.
 
 Sunday Stu came over and we blasted out some [*Paper
Mario*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ILS1K/mhsvortex).
About seven hours of that and we had made quite a bit of progress. Lots
of fun - I haven't played much of that sort of game and I'm really
digging it.
 
 I have the [*24*
game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B0RWWS/mhsvortex) and
we'll probably fire that up in the next couple of weeks after we finish
*Paper Mario*. I find I need to focus on one game at a time or I forget
what's going on.
 
 Good times this weekend, and helpful in recovery for the week.
