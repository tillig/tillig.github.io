Saturday was reasonably uneventful - we picked up [our dining room
set](/archive/2006/07/31/wedding-planning-new-helicopter-new-dining-set.aspx)
and it looks great (aside from a flaw in one of the chair cushions,
which is going to get replaced). My dad helped me cart that home from
the furniture warehouse and get that all set up, Jenn polished
everything up, and my Tiny Cat promptly hopped up on the table and left
little cat prints all over. All went well.
 
 Sunday was pretty cool, though. At 11:00a Jenn and I met up with my
parents, [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), and Stu's parents for
lunch at [Hometown Buffet](http://www.buffet.com/). Stu's parents were
in for a couple of weeks visiting from England and it was really great
to finally meet them. Unfortunately, while his sister and brother-in-law
were also here visiting, they were both feeling ill so they stayed at
the hotel and we didn't get to meet them.
 
 After a pretty decent lunch (they were still serving breakfast food
until about 11:30, so we got a taste of both breakfast and lunch), my
parents headed out and the rest of us went back to my place to play some
[*Alhambra*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/6249). Of course,
following the unfortunate luck of Stu's sister and brother-in-law, just
as we got the game set up, they got a phone call saying they had headed
in to an urgent care facility to get some assistance and Stu's parents
left to go meet them. (Everything turned out okay, it sounds like they
had just gotten dehydrated or something the day before.)
 
 Stu stayed behind and we put in some units on Oblivion as it'd been a
couple of weeks since we last did so. We finished a few quests and after
probably four or five hours we called it a night so Stu could go see
everyone one last time that evening. Their flight was scheduled to leave
this morning; I think they're on it right now.
 
 Anyway, it was really cool to finally put faces to the stories we hear
about Stu's childhood and next time they visit (or if we end up over
there) it'd be great to spend more time with them. Maybe we'll also get
to meet his sister and brother-in-law as well!
 
 In other news, I have a meeting with [the
painters](/archive/2006/08/18/painting-has-become-a-fiasco.aspx) today
at 4:00p to discuss what needs to be done to rectify the trim painting
situation. I'm going to do my best to keep my cool about it because I
just want it dealt with, but I think it's crap that they just can't do
their own QA on this stuff. It's paint, people, not rocket science.
