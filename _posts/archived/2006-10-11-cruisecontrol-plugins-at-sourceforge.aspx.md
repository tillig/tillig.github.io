There is a set of plugins for CruiseControl.NET out on SourceForge that
lets you serialize tasks. Handy for those long-running
resource-intensive operations that need to run exclusively of other
instances of the same operation (like automating UI windows during
test).
 
 I haven't tried them yet, but [they look
cool](http://ccnetplugins.sourceforge.net/).
