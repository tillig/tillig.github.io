[![Grammaton Cleric... or Neo from The Matrix (6k

wore my costume to work today because we have a company Halloween
costume contest. Plus, I figured I went to all the work of making it and
I'm only going to one party, so I should make some use of my effort,
right? So I did.

 Went to the contest at noon and found that about 11 of us dressed up,
with varying efforts. People all morning had commented on how cool they
thought my coat was and they were pretty impressed that I had made it
myself. I have to admit, I'm pretty pleased with myself and with how it
turned out - it's a good looking deal. Even though nobody's seen
[*Equilibrium*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLWN/mhsvortex),
so I just copped out and said it was Neo from [*The
Matrix*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AXE8I/mhsvortex).
Same difference, right?

 Anyway, the contest had four categories - funniest, most original,
scariest, and coolest. Of those four, I got the *scariest* costume.
Scariest? You know what? *I didn't question it.* I don't win *anything
ever*, so I wasn't looking the gift horse in the mouth on this one.

 I walked away with a bag of M&M's and the DVD [*The Sixth
Sense*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004BZIY/mhsvortex),
which is a great movie that I don't have yet.

 Amazing how a small reward and *getting recognized for your
accomplishments and hard work* can make all the difference in the
world.
