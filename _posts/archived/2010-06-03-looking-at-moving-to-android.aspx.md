Now that I've got [my calendar/contact sync issues pretty much
resolved](/archive/2010/05/25/calendar-and-contact-sync-software-recommendation-gsyncit.aspx),
I'm starting to think about moving to an Android-based phone. You know,
because [I can't leave well enough
alone](/archive/2010/05/27/my-problem-is-i-cant-leave-well-enough-alone.aspx).

[Apparently Amazon has opened a new wireless
store](http://wireless.amazon.com/?tag=mhsvortex), which is interesting,
and looks like, at the very least, a sort of vendor-neutral place you
can see what's out there. My current leading choice, since I'm on
Verizon now, is [the HTC Droid
Incredible](http://wireless.amazon.com/dp/B003HC8NUW?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex).
The speed and screen are appealing, and the camera is hands down better
than my crappy Blackberry Curve camera (even if the Incredible [gives
things a slight blue
tint](http://androidandme.com/2010/05/phones/the-incredible-camera-showdown-droid-incredible-vs-nexus-one/)).

Maybe in a couple of weeks or so, when I have a weekend free to head in
and switch. I'll need the weekend to get myself all set up. :)
