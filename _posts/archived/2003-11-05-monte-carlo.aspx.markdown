Yesterday was *packed chock-full* of shit for me to do.

 At 7:00a I had my usual once-every-four-weeks haircut. By 8:00a I was
at the allergy doctor's office getting my weekly round of allergy shots.
9:00a I got to work.

 Got a lot done at work. I'm still working on the product demo, but it's
getting closer to the deadline and I'm almost done.

 Okay, I just now got a sales call and I have to throw it in here
because it was just dumb.

 I hate sales calls.

 Okay, back to yesterday.

 At 3:00p the company had a cosmic bowling event I went to. It was hella
fun, even though I don't know half the people who showed up. (I'm not
too social at work. Go figure.) I ended up bowling with Chris, our CTO,
who, as it turns out, is a pretty cool guy on a social level. I think he
was sharking me at bowling, though, because he'd bowl two or three
gutterballs, then get like six strikes in a row. Huh.

 They had a Monte Carlo bowling thing going for a while, too, and I won
\$25. Not bad for an afternoon at work, eh?

 My average ended up around the 130 range and my high was 180. Can't
complain about that, except today my wrist is a little sore and my left
ass cheek is *killing me*. (Get your mind out of the gutter [bad bowling
pun not intended] - I'm a right-handed bowler, so I slide on my approach
with my left leg.)

 I was *supposed* to get together last night with Gerb, a friend of mine
who I hardly saw when he was away at college and now I hardly see him
and he only lives like 20 blocks away. We planned to get together like a
week or so ago and then he ended up working late instead of coming over.
I guess that's just the way it goes.

 Instead, I spent the evening networking the new computer to the old one
and migrating documents and settings. I haven't got the modem for the
new computer yet so I had to run Internet Connection Sharing (sucky
sucky) so the new one could download and install patches from Windows
Update. That alone almost convinced me I need DSL or cable modem. There
were like 80MB of patches and things to download, which means it's
probably still going. I know it was this morning. Bah.

 I also settled in and watched my copy of [*The Matrix
Reloaded*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AXE8I/mhsvortex)
in preparation for my viewing of [*The Matrix
Revolutions*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/) next week on the
company outing. After watching it for the second time (first time since
the theater), I think it's starting to grow on me a bit. You really
can't look at it from a standalone movie point of view; you have to look
at it not only in its context in the trilogy, but also from a "what
points are they making philosophically?" standpoint.
Entertainment-wise... eh. But raw analysis? Very interesting. I
definitely picked up on some stuff I didn't catch the first time because
I was too preoccupied with the suckiness factor.

 It's still not as good as it should have been.

 Oh, and I've decided after [researching
it](http://members.brabant.chello.nl/%7em.heijligers/ipod/encodingobservations.html)
and talking to some folks that I'm going to stop ripping my CDs in to
320kbps MP3 and instead use 256kbps AAC/M4A. It'll save some room on the
ol' iPod without really giving up much in the way of quality, and that's
the happy medium I'm going for. Am I re-ripping my existing stuff?
Probably. I haven't really ripped too many of my CDs anyway. Ideally I
could rip them all into a digital, lossless format and then have a
conversion program that encodes them into whatever format of the day I'm
using. But I don't have a terabyte drive to store all the originals on,
so screw it. 256kbps AAC it is.
