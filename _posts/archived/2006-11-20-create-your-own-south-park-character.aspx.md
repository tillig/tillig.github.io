Over at [South Park Studios](http://www.southparkstudios.com/) they have
a [Create-a-Character Flash
game](http://images.southparkstudios.com/games/create/sp_game.swf) where
you can create your own South Park character.

 I made one of me:

character]({{ site.url }}/images/20061120southpark_me.jpg)

 And of course I did Jenn and [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net),
too:
