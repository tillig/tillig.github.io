Watched [*Survivor*](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor6/) last night
at my parents' house. I was glad they voted
[Joanna's](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor6/survivors/prof/joanna.shtml)
whiny, annoying, overly-pious, off-key-singing, stupid ass off the show
because she was irritating the living shit out of me.
 
 I finished the majority of the sewing on this hat project I'm working
on before *Survivor* started. It turned out pretty good, but I'm no
professional tailor or anything. Now I've gotta wash it to get the
disappearing ink to, well, *disappear*, and then I'm going to iron it
and start beading it. I think once the beads get put on it'll be a lot
better. Right now it looks sort of *rumpled* and, while I am pretty
pleased with it, I think it could be *better*.
 
 We went to lunch today with the CTO of the company. He took the
department out because he claims we're doing a good job. I appreciate
that he thinks so, but I'm honestly waiting for the other shoe to drop.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
 
 The end of the hockey season is approaching, and I'm glad to see it
coming. The [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) suck this season
and as much as I enjoy hockey and seeing my hockey friends, it's
difficult to pay money for season tickets to a losing team. I have hope
that next season the coach will kick their asses if they suck this bad
again. I think we have like three games left; next Sunday is our last
game. Hey, maybe I'll actually have some free time after that. Wouldn't
that be novel?
 
 I have learned a lot about SQL Server databases in the past couple of
days. The primary lesson is: if you have a 10GB database on a 25GB drive
and you decide to delete a large portion of the database, the database
transaction log will not hesitate to fill up the remaining 15GB of disk
space and crash the system.
 
 Rockstar Games is [distributing the original Grand Theft Auto game for
PC - free!](http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/) All you have to do
is sign up and download it. It's 300+ MB, so a fast connection is key,
but that's cool that they're giving it away. I downloaded it and burned
it to disc. I'll have to try it out one of these days.
 
 I cannot wait for March 23 - I am impatient for my [GBA
SP](http://pocket.ign.com/articles/381/381613p1.html).
