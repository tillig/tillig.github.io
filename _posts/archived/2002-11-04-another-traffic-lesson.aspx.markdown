During my commute this morning I was graced with the presence of yet
another driver who [doesn't know how to
merge](/archive/2002/04/02/a-public-safety-announcement.aspx). It seems
that some folks *just don't get it*. It's real simple, folks. It breaks
down like this:
 
 *If you're merging, adjust to the traffic around you. Don't just expect
traffic to stop and let you in because you're a moron.*
 
 There is a tiny corrollary that goes along with this:
 
 *If you think you're going to miss your exit because you waited too
long to merge, that's your tough cookies. Go to the next exit and turn
around. Dumbass.*
 
 Let's put that in pictures for the people in the cheap seats.

 This is actually what happened to me today. This punk bitch decides
that, rather than just easing in *behind me* where there's plenty of
space, she will just cruise on up and jump in because - hey - who wants
to wait in line like the rest of the crowd? She was obviously someone
*very important*, too. I know this because she thought it beneath her to
even signal that she wanted in my lane; she started easing over, *then*
started signalling. Courtesy for us proletariat folk.
 
 Needless to say, she did not get into my lane. She nearly took off my
passenger side mirror before she figured out that I wasn't going to cave
in. I gave her a liberal dose of the horn and continued on my merry way.
Surprisingly, she did *not* try to speed up and give me the finger.
 
 I think if I ever get laid off, I'll sign up to become a traffic cop. I
swear they'd never have to raise taxes again. I'd be the hardest-assed
traffic cop this side of the mighty Mississip', I kid you not.
