Lots of change in recent times has brought about some new discoveries
and new fun favorite things. Here are a few of the things Jenn and I
have gotten into lately.
 
 [![Simple Italian
Sandwiches](https://hyqi8g.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2p4ysWtcupqLbchycOsFOm1Z_qYitD8gYZ5iqdrpW9K4x64inenFRPU0JlCHIF1UGDtt-HFi2DshjC5YGLIIdO3-e0FWGp0Zj10bNdJUZQjxk/20070109panini.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006059974X/mhsvortex)
**Panini**: My sister and brother-in-law got us an ice cream maker for a
late wedding/Christmas gift, but Jenn and I are too fat already so we
ended up taking it back to Williams-Sonoma to see what else they have we
might need. While there, I saw [this
cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006059974X/mhsvortex)
and somehow got an insatiable craving for panini. Within the next two
days we got a [panini
grill](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008PC7M/mhsvortex) and
are now addicted to panini.

 [![I Love New
York](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pjC9Hb0wjvrK9tpRS-wL0Cz-6aTbgvUUHMHeP9rHa3uxvZWbjSGyldtDoqaO_Qml_WuzBlXV6sBPJiVf-EHy2AVh5XUn5niBG1Li1ssTTM9E/20070109newyork.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/i_love_new_york/series.jhtml)
**I Love New York**: If you thought [*Flavor of
Love*](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/flavor_of_love_2/series.jhtml) was a
train wreck of global proportions, you *have* to see the spin-off [*I
Love New
York*](http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/i_love_new_york/series.jhtml). The
contestant we all love to hate is back, and she's got her own show. I
can't even begin to describe it, and I can't tear my eyes off the
screen.

 [![Gears of
War](https://hyqi8g.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2pBmwRigU2lhl_JlnBQAji13K8szSfT_2ycF-81bjB4L-Z1B0DBDxMcvzuLCp1W_x715-59i5GEHQDaLVK_v16MEAWIrHpHk9qXU0khPoDjCI/20070109gearsofwar.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FRS9II/mhsvortex)
**Gears of War**: I got [this
game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000FRS9II/mhsvortex) for
Christmas and am *loving it*. I haven't gotten online yet - I'm waiting
to get through the single player campaign and hone my mad skillz a bit
first - but even the single player campaign is great.

 [![Lego Star Wars
II](https://hyqi8g.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y2pYM4o2fdWAHiAp_dgdnoQd4Dl3sZCquuZ1w2De39X5sXnrMdJj7BioAt36Ektz_YbVEcBLd3mnwyTIqXEPb397d6Tnvefa_npAhKaN7w9x-s/20070109legosw2.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000G7X0AO/mhsvortex)
**Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy**: Jenn and I can't play games
together because we are far too competitive, but [this one seems to
work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000G7X0AO/mhsvortex). I
got it for Jenn for Christmas and it's hella fun.
