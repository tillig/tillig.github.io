Friday was Phoenix's first birthday, so on Saturday we had her party.

The party was supposed to start at 12:30p, but everyone seemed to be
there about an hour early, so it was anarchy from the get-go. Phoenix
didn't seem to mind getting passed from person to person the entire
time. It took a bit for her to get into the gift opening spirit, not
quite being sure what to do with the wrapping paper, but after being
shown how easily it rips, she figured it out.

I'm pretty sure her favorite part of the whole thing was the cake. She
really dug into that and ate an entire piece.

We wrapped it up by a bit after 5:30p and cleaned the house for most of
the rest of the night. I'm guessing that's the signs of a successful
first birthday party. Right?

It's pretty amazing what a kid learns in just a year. From being pretty
much motionless in a cradle to walking around the house at full speed,
opening drawers and cabinets. From not being interested in anything to
pointing and being interested in everything. She doesn't talk much yet,
just "ball" and "hello" (she puts her hand up to her ear like she's
holding a phone every time she says hello - that's Grandma Illig in
action, there). She's not afraid of anything.

After everyone left, she ran over to the stairs (she's normally kept in
an area without stairs, blocked off by baby gates) and climbed all the
way to the top by herself (with Daddy on her tail, just to be sure). She
did that three times.

Such a big girl now, and a total maniac. She is *everywhere*, all the
time.

Happy birthday, miniature baby. Mommy and Daddy love you.
