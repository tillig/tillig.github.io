I got a catalog in the mail this weekend for "[The Noble
Collection](http://www.noblecollection.com/)." Normally I'm not too into
the whole "collector's reproductions of movie crap" thing, but this
stuff rocks. They have a great [section on *Harry
Potter*](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/catalog.cfm?catid=21) as
well as a really cool [section on *Lord of the
Rings*](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/catalog.cfm?catid=17).

 I didn't even like *Lord of the Rings*, but I have to admit, I *must
have* the [18K One
Ring](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/product.cfm?id=NN8881&catid=17).
Like, to the point that... well, I don't wear jewelry of any nature, but
I'm considering getting the [sterling silver version of the
thing](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/product.cfm?id=NN3268&catid=17),
just to see how I like it (and to see the quality of the stuff these
folks sell).

 I also think the [revolving elvish script
ring](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/product.cfm?id=NN6498&catid=17)
is pretty cool.

 And to answer my dad's question from this weekend: No, [Liv
Tyler](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000239/) does not come free with
purchase of [Arwen-related
items](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/product.cfm?id=NN0574&catid=17),
nor does [Cate Blanchett](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/) come with
[Galadriel
items](http://www.noblecollection.com/catalog/product.cfm?id=NN3247&catid=17).
Sorry.
