Two interesting articles I happened across this morning.

 First, [Slashdot
reports](http://slashdot.org/articles/06/11/29/1331212.shtml) that
Businessweek.com has a piece on how LEGO bricks are made. There's [a
walkthrough](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/11/1129_makingof_lego/index_01.htm)
and [a very interesting
article](http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/nov2006/db20061127_153826.htm).

 Second, Gizmodo is running a clip showing [a Chinese supermarket that
installed a rollercoaster in its
aisles](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/clips/lollercoaster-crazy-chinese-rollercoaster-supermarket-217833.php).
You sit in the coaster and grab items as you pass. I might have to shop
there for the novelty alone.
