...The Home of the No-Splinter, Full-Woody Tropical Dream Vacation (and
Spa Salon).
 
 ***Huge*** brownie points to whoever knows what *that's* from.
 
 (If you really don't know, you can get a taste

 I'm having an interestingly bland day today. Not a whole lot going on,
as is usual during holiday weeks. I'm being nickel-and-dimed to death
with pissant requests. Modify a user account, check on this server, run
around with no pants on...
 
 Okay, maybe I've kept my pants on all day long, but the rest of the
requests were pretty lame.
 
 I went today and traded in [*Virtua Fighter
4*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y1BG/mhsvortex). [I
bought it a while ago](/archive/2002/09/25/the-buff-is-back.aspx) and
after playing it a few times, I realize that it is too large and
complicated for my tiny brain to grasp. In exchange (with an additional
few dollars), I got [*Kingdom
Hearts*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066TS5/mhsvortex), a
role-playing game with Disney characters in it. I've never been a huge
RPG fan, but we rented this one a couple of days ago and it's fun. Even
Jenn is sucked in, which is cool because it's hard to find games she
likes.
 
 I also picked up a copy of [*Ice
Age*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006CXHU/mhsvortex)
because it was pretty funny. I didn't like it as much as the
[Pixar](http://www.pixar.com/) movies that have come out, but it held
its own.
 
 I've got a haircut to get to, so I'm gonna get out of here.
