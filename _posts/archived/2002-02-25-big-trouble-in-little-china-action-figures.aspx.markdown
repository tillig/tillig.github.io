For those interested in such things, I found that N2 Toys is going to
make [Big Trouble in Little China action
figures](http://www.n2toys.com/btilc_main.html). That's pretty cool. Now
if they'd just hurry up on their line of [Fifth Element action
figures](http://www.aftimes.com/2001tf/n2toys/main.shtml)...
