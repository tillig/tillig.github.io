I've been working on several different projects where I'm learning new
stuff from scratch.  For example, I'm trying to write my own
[Subtext](http://www.subtextproject.com) skin for my blog.  And as I
read the documentation (or attend the meeting, or watch the
presentation, etc.) that was created to convey the information to me, I
realize that the creator of the material has always omitted the one
thing that would suddenly allow the concept to click:

Context.

Picking on the Subtext skinning (since it's fresh in my mind): It might
be super important to tell me which lines in file XYZ need to be changed
to show me how to make it do something interesting, but if you don't
tell me what file XYZ is and what its purpose is, the only thing I'm
going to learn is that if you do *this specific change*, you'll get
*this specific result*.  I don't have any context for why you made that
change, so I can't really infer any other changes that I could
potentially make.  All I learned was the example.

I had a friend who would explain game rules this way.  If she was trying
to explain, say,
[Monopoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)), rather than
starting out with explaining how the pieces move or what the object of
the game is, she'd start out right in the middle with something like how
you get sent to jail and how you get out, or what happens to you if you
roll doubles.  If you already know how to play and need a refresher,
that's one thing, but for the new person you're trying to explain the
game to, you're forgetting to provide context.

I see this happen a lot with folks who work on projects for a long
time.  When it's time to demo the end result of the project, they jump
right in at the middle, forgetting to explain the overall value of the
project, why the audience should care, or what the audience is about to
see.  The problem there is that the audience will more than likely just
nod their heads and tell you that they understand when the truth is they
don't.  Why didn't they get it?  *No context.*

So here's my public request to anyone trying to convey any information
to anyone anywhere - provide context.  Your audience will thank you.
