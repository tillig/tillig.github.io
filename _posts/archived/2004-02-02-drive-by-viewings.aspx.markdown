Jenn and I drove past the three house candidates on Saturday afternoon
that the realtor sent over and further reduced the competition there
down to two potentials. Those are the two we want to see inside so we
can better gauge whether or not they're any good. The outsides (and
neighborhoods) on the two are good, though. So I guess we'll see.
 
 I find that the descriptions in listings are slightly misleading in
some cases. For example, the house we ruled out was supposed to be on a
cul-de-sac. Last I checked, that implied a street that has sort of a
round end to it. My parents live on a cul-de-sac and it's decent. What
we found when we got there was the house situated at the squared-off end
of a one-lane road. Yes, that means no room to turn around, no curbside
parking for visitors, and a very cramped feel. Thank you, no. As nice as
it might be inside, that's not something I think I could put up with for
years to come.
 
 I'm kind of excited, in a sick sort of way, to see what
MortgageDesignGroup.com can come back with estimate-wise. The more I
think about the features and services they offer, the more I like them.
