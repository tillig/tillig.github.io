There's this guy at the local video store who seems to be in there every
time we go. I'm sure you've got one of these guys at your video store,
too.

 He's maybe 25. His fingernails are half an inch long and dirty
underneath. His hair has been neither washed nor combed in... well,
*ever*. That Grizzly Adams beard has *got* to go. When you check out, he
talks to you in a monotone voice and asks things like
"wouldyoubeinterestedinourtwoforonepreviouslyviewedmovies?"

 Oh, and he snorts and clears his throat repeatedly while he stands
there behind the register.

 Ugh.

 We call him "Mr. Hygiene."
