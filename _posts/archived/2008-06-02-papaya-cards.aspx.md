I hate shopping for cards because they're always super lame. The art is
always the same, the sentiments inside are campy and cliché... I always
end up getting something and sort of apologizing for the lameness of it
all.

I found [PaPaYa! cards](http://www.papayalicious.com) at [Elephant's
Deli](http://www.elephantsdeli.com/) this weekend and I'm sold. They're
blank inside, which is fine, and the art is amazing and cool and
creative and different. I'm going to have to see what holidays are
coming up that I need to send cards for and start ordering.
