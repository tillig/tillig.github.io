I've been considering upgrading my hard drive from my 20GB drive to
something larger in the potentially near future because I'm starting to
get somewhat low on free space and, while I have a spare 20GB drive,
switching drives isn't [teh
hawesome](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hawesome).

I was worried about the licensing issues - like whether or not the
licenses would transfer from the old drive to the new one, since the DRM
on Xbox Live has been the bane of my very existence - but [my friend
Alex has done the transfer process and it sounds like it came off
without a
hitch](http://itmanager.blogs.com/notes/2008/12/transferring-data-from-old-20gb-xbox-360-drive-to-new-120gb-drive.html).
I asked and he verified that he was able to log in and use content on
the console from an account other than the one that purchased the
content, which proves that the content was still licensed to the
console, not just his account.

Maybe an upgrade will be in order soon.
