Last week was \#32 for me. I had a great time [the weekend before
last](/archive/2008/07/21/birthday-weekends-plural.aspx), checking out
*The Dark Knight* and hitting the driving range.

On the day of my birthday my parents came over and brought dinner - Mom
made this super-tasty Mexican meal. I ate far too much of that and had
some cheesecake when it was all done. They also got to visit [the new
kittens](/archive/2008/07/06/welcome-kai-and-stanley.aspx), who are
starting to get big but no less wild. Jenn got me a red and black
Nintendo DS with *[Guitar Hero: On
Tour](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013ZEMUK?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0013ZEMUK)*.
My parents got me a case for all that and *[Mario Kart
DS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2R54M?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000A2R54M)*.

This past weekend, we went to the Washington County Fair on both Friday
night and Saturday. I rode one of the rides called "El Niño" with Jenn
and our friends Angela and K. It was pretty crazy and probably one of
the better traveling fair rides I've been on. We also saw [The Pirate's
Parrot show](http://www.thepiratesparrot.com/) and it was great as
usual, even though I got a pretty decent sunburn out of it. I hope they
come back again next year.

In the end, it was a pretty great birthday. It's going to be a while
before I reach my next power of 2, so I'm going to have to savor this
one.
