I was headed to the hockey game last night and noticed I had a flat tire
before I pulled out of the garage. On further inspection, all four tires
were totally bald. Time to get new tires.

 Went to [Les Schwab](http://www.lesschwab.com) this morning and picked
up some [new
tires](http://www.lesschwab.com/tires/performance/tpt.html). $681
later, I was on my way to work. (Admittedly, I bought some pretty decent
65,000 mile performance tires, not your stock generic tire.)

 Damn, tires are expensive.
