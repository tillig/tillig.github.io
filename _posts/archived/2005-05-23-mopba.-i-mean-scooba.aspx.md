I love my Roomba. LOVE IT. I may have to get a second one because we
love it so much.

 I heard rumor they might be coming out with a floor mopping robot. I
laughed that it would be "Mopba."

 [Turns out it's
real.](http://www.irobot.com/consumer/scooba_sneak_preview.cfm) It's
actually called "Scooba" and it'll be out for the holidays. ***I must
have one.***
