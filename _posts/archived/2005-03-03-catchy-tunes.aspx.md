I've noticed that [there are some songs that are just
catchy](/archive/2002/08/29/edge-of-seventeen.aspx), but lately I've
noticed a couple of songs that have particular parts that are catchy. I
mean, while I like the songs as a whole, there are specific verses or
lines that stick with me.
> "I rock a lawsuit when I'm going to court, a white suit when I'm
> getting divorced, a black suit at the funeral home and my birthday
> suit when I'm home alone." - [Good Charlotte, "I Just Wanna
> Live"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002X590Q/mhsvortex)
>
> "What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept? What part
> of your memory is selective and tends to forget?" - [Alanis
> Morissette, "Hands
> Clean"](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005TPKC/mhsvortex)

 Something about the delivery of those particular lines in those
particular songs makes the song itself better; like it's a mini "perfect
song" within a song. I'm not sure what it is, but I dig it.
