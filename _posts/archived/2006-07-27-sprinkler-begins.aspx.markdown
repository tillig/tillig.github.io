We got this voicemail last night from [Dennis' Seven
Dees](http://www.sevendees.com/), the folks we contracted with to get
our sprinkler system put in. The message was, "Tomorrow morning at 8:00
a crew will be out to start your irrigation system project."
 
 I just signed the contract a couple of weeks ago and the guy I talked
to said they were booked five weeks out and they'd let me know when
they'd be coming. I was under the impression I'd need to call the
utilities to get them to mark their buried lines, get permits from the
city for the development, and do some additional prep work. I've done
none of that, and that was sort of worrisome.
 
 But looking out the window... someone has already come along and
painted the utility markings. What the...?
 
 Jenn is off today (having to work this weekend) so she was there this
morning when they showed up and let them know that we hadn't prepared.
They had taken care of everything. They called for the utilities to be
marked, they got the required permits, and they'll be done by
Wednesday.
 
 She sent me a text message mentioning how organized they are, too,
which is cool. It's always nice to see an organized, professional team
at work.
 
 It's costing me a bit - \$5600 for the whole job - but the majority of
that cost is due to the funky shape of the yard and the placement of the
water pipes (there's a lot of extra work that will have to be done to
get the water where it needs to go). Could I have gotten it for cheaper?
Maybe, but I got a couple of quotes and they all came in around the same
ballpark until you really started cutting corners or omitting full
sections of the landscaping. Could I have done it myself? Maybe, but I
don't know the first thing about sprinklers, and I'm sure there's more
to it than I'm willing/able to grasp. There's a reason people get paid
to do what they do - I don't expect anyone off the street to be able to
code like I do; it shouldn't necessarily be expected that anyone off the
street can just come in and do a sprinkler system.
 
 On the other hand, with things like this, I've found you really get
what you pay for. It might sound expensive, but you don't have to fight
with the pipes, dig the trenches, wire everything up, calculate where
the sprinkler heads will go... and having the parts and labor warranty
doesn't hurt, either.
 
 That "you get what you pay for" lesson has been learned by Jenn and I
several times over, and much as we'd love to cut corners and cost on
things, we usually find it better to save up for a little longer and
make the investment in the higher quality product which is inevitably
more expensive. (Which isn't to say "more expensive == higher quality" -
just that if you want a decent product or service, you really need to be
willing to pay for it.)
 
 I'm anxious to see how far they get in a day. And I'm stoked to get
this thing in - the yard is really starting to look like crap, and it's
mostly due to the inability of us to get the water where it needs to be.
Once this bad boy's in, it's time to call in
[ProGrass](http://www.prograss.com/) to come in and do some soil
treatments and fertilization. Then it's going to look gooooooood.
