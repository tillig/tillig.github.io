I went to lunch today with my friend Colin. He introduced me to a local
joint called "[Reo's
Ribs](http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/33622305)." I guess the
place used to be one of those traveling roach coaches and now it's
expanding to be more of a full-size restaurant. It's this guy named Reo
who has this huge oil-drum-style grill and cooks up pork, chicken, and
beef products on it, dowsing it generously in his special BBQ sauce.

 I had the BBQ beef sandwich, and let me tell you - *it was the best BBQ
beef sandwich I've ever had*.

 I mean, this is the [Krispy Kreme](http://www.krispykreme.com/) of
barbecue. Dollar for dollar, you can't go wrong with this place. I ate
the sandwich and the side of red beans and rice (even the side dishes
rule), then went for a slice of sweet potato pie. I could have eaten
more until I got sick and still wanted it. It was that good.

 I actually got to meet Reo while I was there. Nice guy.

 Anyway, you *have to go*. Maybe I'll see you there.

 Side note: I am still trying to find a place to [exchange my *Buffy*
season 2 DVD set](/archive/2002/08/26/i-went-to-the-animal-fair.aspx).
I've tried all the local [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com) stores,
but none of them ever seem to have it in stock. I tried [Best
Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com) last night, but they were jerks about the
whole thing, so I left.

 This got me frustrated, so I called my mom. (Mom works in the main
office at Fred Meyer so I figured she'd know what to do.) Mom gave me
the number for the DVD buyer at the main office, who I called and found
that the closest store to me that has it in stock is in Salem.
(Incidentally, they also have it at the Juneau, AK, store, but I'm not
ready to make the drive.) Anyway, since they don't have it, they're
going to set one aside for me in the next shipment so I can swap out the
next time some come in.

 Thank goodness. I really don't know what I'd do if Mom didn't work in
the main office of Freddy's. I guess I'd be a frustrated consumer just
like *everyone else out there*. It's good to be me.
