As [requested in comments](/archive/2004/03/05/an-end-to-suspense.aspx),
here's the Official Housewarming Gift Guide. Buy me stuff! We will be
having a party at some point once we're unpacked, and the price of
admission is a gift.
 
 (Okay, I'm joking about all that, but for the people who actually do
want to know what we need, here's a list. I'll keep this constantly
updated with new and changing things, so check back before you get
anything. I'll also be updating the registries constantly.)

    fast friends with these folks)
-   [Sears](http://www.sears.com/) (Not for the softer side, mind you)
-   [Michaels](http://www.michaels.com/) (I still have lots of stuff to
    frame correctly... get rid of some of these cheaper/ugly frames)
