So Jenn and I got home late last night after hanging out with some
friends. We're tired and trying to sleep.
 
 5:19a Sunday morning, we get this phone call. It doesn't seem to appear
on the caller ID, so I pick it up. It's 5:19a - it's gotta be life or
death, right?
 
 **Travis**: Hello?
 **Caller**: Hi, is Jennifer there?
 **T**: Who can I tell her is calling?
 **Caller**: This is Raymund.
 **T**: Can I tell her what this is about? Come on, man, it's 5:19 in
the morning.
 **Raymund**: It's about a child of ours.
 
 I handed the phone to Jenn, but by the time I got it to her, he had
hung up.
 
 That shit weirded me out. I mean, that's the kind of phone call you get
when the guilty serial murderer's brother knows who the next target is
and wants them to wake up and get out of the house.
 
 I got up, checked all the rooms, and found that the caller ID on one of
the other phones picked it up:
 
 **Raymond Rosales. 541-212-6379.**
 
 I looked it up online, and while I can't seem to find an address for
it, it's an Ontario, OR, based number. Sprint's the carrier. I couldn't
find anything else.
 
 Anyway, if anything happens to us, call Raymund. That was some fishy
shit. I've had like three hours of sleep and my adrenaline's got me up
now. I'm gonna have to watch a movie and chill out, then maybe take a
nap later today.
