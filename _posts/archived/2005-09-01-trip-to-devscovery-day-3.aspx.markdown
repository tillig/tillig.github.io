Day 3 has been the best of the three days, I think. The first lecture of
the day I went to was on COM interop and had some really interesting
stuff. Unfortunately, again, it didn't quite end on time and I had to
leave before it was over in order to make it to a unit testing lecture.
 
 The unit testing/code coverage lecture rocked. Great information on
some unit testing and code coverage tools, suggestions on integrating it
into your regular development and build process... very interesting.
 
 I filled out my comment sheet (adding all of the information you've
already seen here, so it's not like I'm just blogging and being
passive-aggressive) and they gave us a copy of [*Programming
.NET*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735613761/mhsvortex) as
well as a raffle ticket. The raffle, which happened after lunch, won me
a copy of [*Threat
Modeling*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619913/mhsvortex).
 
 Just before the third lecture, which was on .NET development tools, I
sidelined the lecturer (again, John Robbins) and showed him
[CR\_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx).
I had looked at the lecture slides ahead of time and noticed he was
going to talk about NDoc. I figured he might be interested in the
preview feature CR\_Documentor offers.
 
 He was pretty psyched - enough so that I got a quick "guest lecturer"
spot to present CR\_Documentor in front of everyone at the lecture. This
marks my first ever lecture appearance, and while I was a bit nervous,
it felt good to get CR\_Documentor out and about. Plus I got a free copy
of [*Writing Secure
Code*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735617228/mhsvortex).
That rocked.
 
 I sent the link and info over to John who will be putting
CR\_Documentor up on the [Wintellect
blog](http://www.wintellect.com/weblogs/wintellect/) ([actual entry
here](http://wintellect.com/WEBLOGS/wintellect/archive/2005/09/02/2251.aspx)).
So if you're coming in from Wintellect, hello!
 
 After this there's one more lecture and then the drive home. It'll be
good to be back, but let me tell you, Friday at work is going to be
unproductive as hell.
