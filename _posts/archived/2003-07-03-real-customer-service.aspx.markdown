[A while ago](/archive/2003/05/12/synchronization.aspx) I was talking
about how I was going to order some [Zaino](http://www.zainobros.com/)
car wax because I had heard some good things about it and it was
reasonably affordable.
 
 Well, I placed my order (I did snail-mail, since at the time that's all
they offered, but they just recently put up a web-based ordering system,
so next time...). But I thought of a question that I wanted to find out
the answer to - they mention on the site that they have applied the
polish "in the Arizona sun," so I started wondering if that was in
*direct* sunlight or what - I mean, you can really mess up your finish
if you do that with normal polish, right?
 
 Thus, I emailed the company's support contact and asked my question.
 
 The *president of the company* wrote me back and answered. (You *can*
apply it in direct sunlight, but you will use up more product than if
you don't. He recommends against, but it doesn't mess you up like
regular polish/wax will.)
 
 **That's customer service.**
