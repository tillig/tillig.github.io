I just published [the new version of my Junction Icon Overlay shell
extension](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx), which
I've renamed now to "Junction Shell Extensions" because I've added a
property sheet that allows you to right-click a junction and see where
it points to.

 If you liked the Junction Icon Overlay, this will probably be a welcome
addition.

 [Go get it!](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx)
