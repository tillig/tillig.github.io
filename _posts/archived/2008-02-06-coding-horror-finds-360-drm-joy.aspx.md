Looks like [Atwood is seeing the ugly Xbox 360 DRM beast for the first
time](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001052.html). This is
something [I've been painfully aware
of](/archive/2008/01/28/status-on-xbox-live-drm-and-dashboard-problems.aspx)
for far longer, as have many other people. Sorry you're having trouble,
Jeff. Maybe you'll have better luck getting a DRM fix out of Microsoft
than the rest of us poor saps.
