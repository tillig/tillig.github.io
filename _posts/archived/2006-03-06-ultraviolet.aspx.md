Why can't Hollywood make movies that look cool *and* have a good plot?

 Went to see [**UltraViolet**](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/) this
weekend because I couldn't stay away from the cool factor. Plus, being a
[Milla](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000170/) fan, I had to see her in
this super-techno-fied world that the previews had pimped so well.

 Dammit!

 The visuals were beautiful. Stunning, really. Graphically, it's
everything I hoped it would be. Gorgeous effects. Awesome fight scenes.
It reminded me of the first time I saw the effects for the first
[**Matrix**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K19E/mhsvortex)
movie - it was *just cool*. (Yeah, it was overly CG. Some folks might
not be into that and bitch that it's "not real enough." I dig CG effects
and *ate it up*.)

 That said, what happened to the plot? I mean, seriously, where was the
QA department on this thing? Did they actually *have* test screenings?

 The idea is that, sometime in the indefinite future, this virus got out
and basically created vampires ("hemophages" in the movie). The
government worked to wipe them out rather than looking for a cure.
Sounds good, right? Then they introduce this kid who is... uh... some
sort of weapon or something (supposedly) and we get caught up in Milla
trying to save the kid and fight the government simultaneously, all the
while looking for a cure for the hemophage virus... I won't spoil the
mediocre plot twist.

 The point is, all this is happening in 88 minutes, so it's moving
altogether too fast. Fast enough that I really didn't get a chance to
care about why this person was shooting this other person. Fast enough
that I had no idea who this rival gang was or why I should be afraid of
them, and definitely fast enough that there was no import when they got
wiped out by a single person.

 Interesting premise, but it reminded me a lot of
[**Underworld**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000VAFO0/mhsvortex)

- great principle, cool world, *horrendous* execution. We left confused
and feeling like we got ripped off. Except for the "Milla Factor" (she
was hot - the whole time, Milla was *just hot*), I want my money back.

 Skip this one, folks, lest you feel duped out of your $7.50. Instead,
go buy a copy of
[**Equilibrium**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLWN/mhsvortex)
and soak up what **UltraViolet** could have been.
