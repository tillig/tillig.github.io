I noticed, about a month ago, that whenever I would log in to Windows
Live Messenger, I'd get a little toast popup telling me to verify my
email address:

![You need to verify your e-mail address with Windows Live Messenger.
Click
here.]({{ site.url }}/images/20071130verifyaddresstoast.jpg)

I clicked, I followed the verification process, and I thought everything
was cool.  Not so.  The prompt kept coming up.  On subsequent times I
tried to verify my address, though, it would tell me that I didn't need
to verify.  What gives?

I had recently taken advantage of [the "linked ID" feature of Windows
Live
IDs](http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2007/10/18/update-to-windows-live-account-enables-linked-ids.aspx). 
The misleading thing here: I did need to verify an email address, just
*not the one I was signing in with*.  Curiously, signing in with the
other IDs didn't prompt me to verify... but that's neither here nor
there.  After fighting my way through support for a month on this (and
specifically asking them if it had to do with my linked IDs), it came
back that, yes, it was something to do with one of the other accounts.

Anyway, if you're getting prompted and you recently linked your IDs,
it's probably a problem with one of the linked accounts.  Make sure
they're *all*verified.
