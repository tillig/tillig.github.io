I took my latest test - *MS070-320 Developing XML Web Services and
Server Components with Microsoft Visual C\# .NET and the Microsoft .NET
Framework* - today at 10:45a (I was scheduled for 11:30a but got there
early) and ***PASSED!***
 
 What that means is that I've finished the requirements for the
*Microsoft Certified Application Developer in .NET* certification.
Further, that means I have only two more tests to go before I can get
the *Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer in .NET* certification,
which is my overall aim here. I may go further and take two tests beyond
*that* to get the *Microsoft Certified Database Administrator*
certification, but I'm not entirely sure. It's been a lot of work so far
and I'm honestly very tired of studying for these things.
 
 Regardless, I passed the test so I'm feeling *really good*. King of
Developers, baby!
