I'm planning on getting an XBox 360 in a month or so and I know the PS3
is coming out some time this year, which means I'm going to be hooking
up some consoles to the TV downstairs (which is the only HD TV in the
house). Only one problem: The TV only has one HD input left on it, so I
need an A/V switcher that supports component video and digital audio.

 Good luck with that one. I found [a bunch at RAM
Electronics](http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/comp-vid-sw.html) (the
[Audio Authority 1154A](http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/1154A.html)
was my favorite), but all are prohibitively expensive - I don't want to
pay $200+ for a stupid A/V switch.

 Luckily I found the [Score System Selector Pro
2.0](http://store.videogamecentral.com/pesyseprocwa.html) at the local
game store. It has six inputs, all of which support component video and
three of which support digital audio. And for $100! Can't beat that.
Guess I'll have to pick one of those up come XBox 360 time. (Well, I
might wait until PS3 time, just to see if some better switcher comes out
on the market or that 1154A drops in price, but the System Selector Pro
2.0 is leading the pack right now.)
