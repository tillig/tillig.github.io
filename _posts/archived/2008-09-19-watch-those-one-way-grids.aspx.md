My car got hit last night while I was on my way to get my allergy shot.
No big deal, just some paint scratches (as far as I can tell), and no
one was injured, but, man, it's just *one more thing* to deal with.

The other driver and I were heading south on a two-way street and
crossed into a one-way grid. He stayed in the right lane, I changed to
the left lane (had to turn left soon to get to the shot clinic). He
didn't realize we had switched into a one-way grid and turned left in
front of me from the right-hand lane. I got to test my brakes out
(they're decent) and we hit at super-low speed.

Here's a map of what happened:

Got the accident reported to the insurance company right at the scene.
Cops didn't come because it was so minor. Now I need to pick a body shop
and get my bumper fixed up. Really glad no one got hurt, but like I
said, just one more thing to deal with. Sigh.
