Last night Jenn and I went to see [*American Idols -
Live!*](http://idolonfox.msn.com/ai_live/ai_live.htm) at the [Rose
Garden](http://www.rosequarter.com/). We both had a totally cool time
and I came out very pleasantly surprised.

 They *did* sing the songs that you saw them sing on the television, but
there were some new ones thrown in the mix, too, that livened it up a
bit. So you sort of knew what you were in for up front, yet it still
held your attention.

 Something I came out very pleased about was that a couple of the people
who I thought weren't all that good when I watched them on television
were fantastic live. You'd be surprised the difference a live band makes
in a performance.

 I will continue to maintain that
[Kelly](http://fox.com/idol/contestants/ind/kelly_clarkson/index.htm)
was a good choice for the winner. She was the best one out there from a
vocal standpoint. On the other hand,
[Justin](http://fox.com/idol/contestants/ind/justin_guarini/index.htm)
was by far the best performer. He had a great repoire with the audience
and just seemed very natural up there.

 For all the folks who wondered why
[Nikki](http://fox.com/idol/contestants/ind/nicky_ozmet/index.htm) came
in third and wasn't eliminated sooner, she proved herself worthy with a
great rendition of Fleetwood Mac's *Rhiannon*. Watching her there made
me realize why she was my original favorite at the start of the show.

 Anyway, it was a blast, and well worth the money. Also, the merchandise
was affordable - \$15 for a t-shirt rather than the typical \$40 you see
at concerts nowadays. I got a program and Jenn got a shirt.

 Something else that was nice about the concert: When we went, we got
all dressed up - not in formal clothes or anything, but decent
"going-out" clothes - and made it an event. I wouldn't call myself "old"
necessarily, but I'll admit that doing that made me feel, well, "young
again." I think I will have to do that more often.

 In other news, my baby Xev cat has an infection where they took her
little uterus out, so we have to try to get her to eat antibiotics twice
a day. You'd be surprised how strong that little cat is when you try to
force-feed her stuff. And fast, too! I think we should be done with that
in a week or so, and hopefully she'll be better then. She has returned
to her usual routine of crying *all night long*, so I can't say she
isn't mostly back to normal already.
