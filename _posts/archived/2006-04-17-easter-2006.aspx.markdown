Easter's come and gone in a massive storm of nonevent. Not that I was
really expecting much to happen, so I suppose my expectations were
entirely valid.
 
 [Stu's](http://www.stuartthompson.net) last day at
[Corillian](http://www.corillian.com) was Friday, so a small group of us
went to Newport Bay for happy hour where we got cheap food and crappy
service for an hour or so to celebrate Stu's liberation. Jenn and Tif
got together for a girls' movie night, so Stu and I played some [*Paper
Mario*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ILS1K/mhsvortex).
 
 Saturday was a clean-up-around-the-house day where Jenn and I finally
got to a lot of the errands and things we'd been putting on "the list"
for the last couple of weeks. Random stuff - shopping, cleaning things,
putting things away, etc. Nothing too exciting there, but it was good
closure on things that needed to be done. After we finished with the
chores, Jenn and I spent some time playing [*Project Gotham Racing
3*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000B6ML28/mhsvortex), where
I thoroughly determined that I'm pretty much no good at it but still
have fun playing.
 
 Sunday was a pretty lazy day, and I suppose that's how it should be on
Easter. Jenn and I went to breakfast at Biscuits Cafe, which is really
good. I had sweet potato pancakes, heavy on the "cake," light on the
"pan." So tasty, yet heavy - like eating a gold brick baked in spice.
Also had some eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon. Just doesn't get better than
that. Fell into a food coma about 10 minutes after leaving.
 
 I spent a couple of hours reading comic books that I'd purchased but
never quite got around to reading, then Stu came over and we finally
finished [*Paper
Mario*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ILS1K/mhsvortex)
(clocking in at about 40 full hours of play). Jenn whipped up some
Indian food - chicken in a spicy ginger sauce - and we all sat and
watched [*SNL: The Best of Phil
Hartman*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00014K5BO/mhsvortex),
where Stu was given a lot of US pop culture reference in one big dose.
 
 Now it's Monday, and frankly, I'm bored. Stu's no longer over the cube
wall from me, and while it's not a showstopper or anything, he did sort
of keep me sane around here.
