I've been up since like 4:00a because I had another stupid headache -
this time sinus related - and I took some [Excedrin
Migraine](http://www.excedrin.com/products/migraine.html) (probably the
only pain reliever that works, though I should look into [Excedrin
Tension Headache](http://www.excedrin.com/products/th.html)) and it has
enough caffeine in it to wake me up. Gets rid of the headache, though -
that and some Allegra.

 Jenn and I like playing games, and I noticed that we have far too many
of the same kind of game. I think we have, seriously, like five
different versions of [*Trivial
Pursuit*](http://www.trivialpursuit.com/), none of which I'm remotely
good at, and we have a bunch of other stuff we thought would be cool,
bought, and had it turn out to be kind of lame. So I'm taking a page
from my friend (and indirect boss) [Chris](http://www.chrisbrooks.org)
and I'm going to go more, well, *avant garde* with my gaming. I took a
look at [his
collection](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/viewcollection.php3?username=CaptainCaveman%20&own=1&rated=both&comment=bothâ„¢both&want=both&rating=&orderby=quickrating&dir=-1),
compared that with some of the ratings I see on
[BoardGameGeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com), and I'm going to make a
trip to [Rainy Day Games](http://www.rainy-day-games.com/) this weekend
to pick something good up. Not sure precisely what yet, but I'm leaning
toward [*Puerto Rico*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/3076) or
[*Ticket to Ride Europe*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/14996).

 We're going to get Comcast phone on April 8, too. My parents have it,
as does [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), and everyone seems to dig
it. They'll put in some needed cable outlets while they're there so
we'll finally have TV in all the rooms in the house. Looking forward to
that.

 No plans really for the weekend. Hopefully nothing that costs money
(other than the trip to the game store) will come up. I ended up buying
a new printer - [HP DeskJet
5940](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000AKX16K/mhsvortex) -
this week (time for an upgrade) and I think that was my mad money for
the time being. (Got it for a steal, though - $60, marked down from
$90. Can't beat that! Stu took advantage of that, too.)
