Jenn flipped on [*Skating With
Celebrities*](http://www.fox.com/skating/) last night as we were waiting
for [*How I Met Your
Mother*](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/how_i_met_your_mother/). As we
were watching, we noticed that [3-time world champion and Olympic gold
medalist] [Dorothy Hamill](http://www.usolympicteam.com/26_13371.htm)
was one of the judges.

 For those not in the know, one of the defining aspects of Dorothy
Hamill's appearance was her haircut. The phrase "Dorothy Hamill Haircut"
conjures images (for most folks in the US) of a particular short
hairstyle. [*Life*](http://www.life.com) magazine called it "one of the
most important fashion statements of the last 50 years."

 Anyway, while we were watching, the conversation went something like
this:

 **Jenn**: Hey, that's Dorothy Hamill!
 **Trav**: Yup. She's a judge.
 **Jenn**: Holy crap, she still has a Dorothy Hamill haircut!
 **Trav**: You are the *smartest woman alive*.
 **Jenn**: Shut up, you know what I meant.
 **Trav**: Yeah, I get it. Dorothy Hamill has a Dorothy Hamill haircut.
I never would have guessed.
 **Jenn**: You're an asshole.

 Jenn doesn't think it was funny, but I'm dying.
