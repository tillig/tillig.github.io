Based [on my previous all-in-one experience with the HP
C7280](/archive/2008/04/11/hp-c7280-all-in-one-great-printer-horrible-scanner.aspx),
when I brought the [Canon PIXMA
MX850](http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=123&modelid=16279)
home, the first thing I did after I installed it was to try out a scan.
I didn't print, I didn't copy, I just scanned.

Freaking garbage.

Not as bad as the HP C7280, mind you, but still pretty bad. I tried a
book cover and two different CD covers. All of them came out with
horrible Moire patterns and pixel artifacts.

I never printed a single page (other than the printer head calibration).
It's already in the box to be taken back.

I've learned something, but I'm not sure what.

-   Should I not trust all-in-one units because their scan capabilities
    will be mediocre at best compared to a dedicated scanner?
-   Should I not trust units with [CIS
    scanners](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/contact_image_sensor.html)
    (as both the HP and Canon had) and look for something with a [CCD
    scanner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device)?
-   Should I not trust units that can attach over the network and/or
    USB? (Though the connection didn't matter when I tried it out both
    ways, so I doubt it's this one.)

Anyway, back to square one.
