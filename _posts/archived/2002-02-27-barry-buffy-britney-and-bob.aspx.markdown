So I'll admit that I got the Barry Manilow greatest hits compilation,
[Ultimate
Manilow](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005USBH/mhsvortex). I
bring that to light right here at the beginning because it implies
immediately what you think it does - that I do, in fact, *enjoy
listening to Barry Manilow*.
 
 So do you. Admit it. The guy is, like, a total pop music icon. He's
like Burt Bacharach - the guy has written songs you probably didn't even
know were his. I learned a new one yesterday - Barry Manilow wrote the
theme to [American
Bandstand](http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/saturday/sa1373.php).
I didn't even know there were words to that song, other than just
"Bandstaaaaand."
 
 A friend of mine at work gave me the pish-tosh when I showed him the
album. He was all, "I bet you listen to John Denver, too."
 
 **Hell, yes**, I listen to John Denver. I have some very positive
childhood memories associated with that guy. So do you. Who hasn't
wanted a bed that was nine feet high and six feet wide? Saying John
Denver sucks is like saying "I hate America and all it stands for." You
just can't do it.
 
 Moving on.
 
 [Buffy](http://www.buffy.com/) last night, as an episode, kinda sucked.
Hang on before you bitch-slap me for that. Lots happened - we get some
closure on the whole "Riley" issue, we get to see Buffy deal with the
Spike affair, we see Xander and Anya come closer together, we witness
the rebirth of the Buffy/Dawn sisterhood. As a series of events, it was
great. I've been waiting for resolution on some of those issues. But as
an episode... Suck City. It felt like a bunch of random events strung
together like a cheap pearl necklace.
 
 The [Self-Made Critic](http://www.brunching.com) has written a great
review of the Britney Spears movie,
[Crossroads](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0275022). Yeah, it's making money,
but it sounds about as lame as we all thought it was going to be. The
review isn't on his web site yet (I got it via the [mailing
list](http://www.brunching.com/selfmade/mailinglist.html)), but keep
checking for it. It's great. (I love the Self-Made Critic. He's the
first critic I've found that I almost always agree with.)
 
 Finally, I got my copy of [Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CY67/mhsvortex). It's
a 2-DVD set with loads of extras. I can hardly wait. I think I'm going
to watch it at work today. That movie rocks.
