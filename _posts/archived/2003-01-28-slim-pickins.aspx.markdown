I took my work keys home with me last night to see if I had the key for
my display case on the ring.
 
 I didn't.
 
 I searched around my house again in a fruitless effort to recover the
damn thing, but I couldn't find that key if my life depended on it. It
is officially gone. Enter the locksmith.
 
 I called one of those 24-hour places just to price stuff out. Turned
out I had two options - either I could have them come to my place and
make a key for the display case at a cost of \$85 - \$125, or I could
take the display case to them and they could make a key for \$25 -
\$35.
 
 No way was I paying \$85+ for a new damn key. But it was also equally
unlikely that I could get the display case down to the locksmith shop.
 
 Some ginger work with a screwdriver and some pliers, and one of the
locks was *liberated* from the case. A little more work and it was back
in its original shape.
 
 I took the lock into the [locksmith's
shop](http://www.yellowpages-ads.com/01233384) this morning. Ten minutes
and \$17 later, I had two keys that worked *better than the originals*.
(Of course, I could have bought new locks for *cheaper* than it cost me
to get a new keys made, but that would mean I'd have to pry the display
case apart... nah.)
 
 Watching the locksmith guy work was amazing. I mean, the guy was *a
machine* - a little picking and some prodding on the lock, next thing
you know there's a key that fits it. I respect anyone who knows what
they're doing - if you can do a job and make it seem like you're
performing *magic*, that's when you're a real professional. It's like
when you see these shows on [TLC](http://tlc.discovery.com/) where you
have this team of like three guys and they build a new house in an hour
and a half or something. It's crazy and wonderful and downright amazing.
That was this locksmith guy. It was cool and it made me want to learn
how to be a locksmith. But then, there's another part of me that really
doesn't want to know how he did it so I can retain that sense of
mystery. Once you learn the magician's secret, it's not magic anymore.
 
 Sometimes I wonder if that's what people think when they see the
programs I write up. Do they think, "Wow, like magic, that totally
solved the problem in an elegant fashion!" or is it more, "Good -
problem solved... moving on now..."? I'd like to think that I maintain
that same level of magical professionalism that I saw at the locksmith's
shop today, but most of the time I think the stuff I do is taken for
granted because of its intangible nature. Not much I can do about that.
 
 Speaking of TLC, it looks like [*Trading
Spaces*](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html)
is going to be on this new [*Discovery HD
Theater*](http://dhd.discovery.com/) thing that's coming out. I'm hoping
that we'll get that with [our digital
cable](http://www.attbroadband.com/); I've got an HDTV and I'd love to
see how it performs.
