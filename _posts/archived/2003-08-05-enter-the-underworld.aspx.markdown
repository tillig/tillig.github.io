I saw a preview this weekend for a movie called [*The
Underworld*](http://www.entertheunderworld.com). It looks like
[*Interview With The
Vampire*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004RFFS/mhsvortex)
meets [*The
Matrix*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K19E/mhsvortex),
which is to say, *fucking awesome*. Vampires vs. Werewolves in a dark,
digitally-enhanced action flick? *Count me IN.*
 
 Jenn's like, "Eh. Whatever." I'm like, *"I'll be the first person at
the first damn showing!"*. Some people just don't get it.
