Every year for Jenn's birthday we take a trip to the beach with some
friends of ours. This year we decided to go down to the [Oregon Coast
Aquarium](http://www.aquarium.org/) in Newport.

I took several pictures that I'll have to post later, but I did get a
nice video of the [Passages of the Deep
exhibit](http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsPassages.asp) where you walk
under the various fish. This particular video shows the sharks in the
exhibit.
