![Grand Theft Auto: Vice
City](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pRzmXML_JKxXNR-GZxFKFmRQrEQZ5_EvLTIqjstqUSdodfWh_HnXaLZ5DbbD694jS0d8_NxSvKaLYmqj7D_1ZfeGNiWmVTRYBaB12CbpalLs/20020612vicecity.gif?psid=1)I'm
noticing that there are a lot of cool games out, or coming out, that I'm
going to have to get. First and foremost, the latest and greatest
installment of the [Grand Theft
Auto](http://www.rockstargames.com/grandtheftauto3/) franchise, *Grand
Theft Auto: Vice City*. I got an email notification that it'll be out on
October 22, 2002. Woohoo! There's not a whole lot of info on it, but you
can read the [news release](http://www.rockstargames.com/news/) on it.
I'll definitely be picking that one up, if it's even half as good as
GTA3.
 
 Let's see... Last night I finished *[Spy
Hunter](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NCA7/mhsvortex)*,
which was quite the ordeal. I'd been playing it off and on for several
months, and not being terribly great at games in general, this one gave
me some trouble. But I've been getting better lately, so I was finally
able to finish all the missions on this thing. I highly recommend it -
it's everything *Spy Hunter* should be.
 
 Next on the list to work on is *[Devil May
Cry](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NCCR/mhsvortex)*.
That's another one that's pretty difficult for the less than coordinated
*moi*, so I anticipate spending some "quality time" working with it.
 
 Other games that I'm going to have to pick up for my PS2 soon/when they
come out:
-   *[Shinobi](http://www.gamespy.com/games/4303.shtml)*
-   *[Auto Modellista](http://www.gamespy.com/games/4578.shtml)*
-   *[Wipeout
    Fusion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066EXR/mhsvortex)*


 
 And, last but not least, for the XBox at work, the next must-buy is
*[Dead or Alive Extreme
Volleyball](http://www.gamespy.com/games/4735.shtml)*. Featuring your
favorite ladies from the fighting games *[DOA2:
Hardcore](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YRVW/mhsvortex)*
and
*[DOA3](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005O0I3/mhsvortex)*,
you get to play a bit of beach volleyball and enjoy the high kicks. I've
only seen the intro trailer for it, but it looks so cheesy (with just
the right T&A factor) that I can't NOT get it.
 
 In other news...
 
 Jenn and I watched that *[American Idol](http://idolonfox.msn.com/)*
show last night, and... wow. I mean, some of the people were
legitimately good, but others were *so utterly horrible* that I wonder
why they would even bother showing up on the thing. Did they actually
think they could make it? Watching these people is like watching a train
wreck - horrible, yet you can't take your eyes off it. And one of the
[judges](http://idolonfox.msn.com/judges/), Simon Cowell (who I'd never
heard of before in my life), is sort of like [Judge
Judy](http://www.judgejudy.com/) - *brutal*, yet totally right.
