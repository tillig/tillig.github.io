This weekend went, as most weekends do, altogether too quickly and now
that it's Monday I can only wonder at the speed with which the weekend
sped by.
 
 Honestly, I barely remember what I did. I know that Saturday morning I
vacuumed the apartment and dusted stuff. That sucked. The rest of
Saturday... I don't remember. We eventually ended up going to [Hollywood
Video](http://www.hollywoodvideo.com/) and renting some movies and the
PS2 game [*The
Sims*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006GSO0/mhsvortex).
 
 Saturday night we ended up playing *The Sims* too long and didn't watch
any of the movies. Jenn and I discovered that *The Sims* is specifically
engineered to appeal to the micromanagers of the world. The stupid
characters you create require *so much attention* that it's almost hard
to have fun with it. We played it forever, just trying to figure out how
to make the characters happy. What we decided is that it's *too real*:
There are just not enough hours in the day to actually keep your
characters happy and meet all of their needs adequately. Just like life,
huh?
 
 Sunday we made the rounds to visit parental units. After a quick stop
at Jenn's parents' house, we went over to my parents' to hear about
their recent trip down through Reno, NV, to Las Vegas, then up through
Provo, UT (for my sister's graduation), then home again. As far as I'm
concerned, yuck. I'm not one for car trips, and this one is no
different.
 
 At one point, they went to [Scotty's Castle in Death
Valley](http://www.nps.gov/deva/FrameSet_culture.htm). Dad told stories
about how the place came to be and what it was all about. Mom told a
story about how bad she had to poop on the way there. I think that
pretty much sums up how that trip went.
 
 While we were there, we watched [*Ghost
Ship*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JLK1/mhsvortex), one
of the movies that Jenn and I had rented. It was actually pretty decent,
with a good ending and everything, sort of like a big *Twilight Zone*
episode.
 
 After that we went home to finish up the laundry while we watched
another of our rentals,
[*Wasabi*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007L4OM/mhsvortex).
That was a French comedy/action movie from [Luc
Besson](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Besson,+Luc) and was pretty good. Great
soundtrack, too. I find that I like to watch foreign films in their
natural language with English subtitles rather than with English
overdubbing. There's something about overdubbing that just doesn't work
for me. Unless it's [Jackie
Chan](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Chan,+Jackie).
 
 After *Wasabi* was a new
[*Alias*](http://abc.abcnews.go.com/primetime/alias/index.html), which
was probably the highlight of my weekend. It ruled, and I can't wait for
next week's two-hour season finale.
 
 And... now it's Monday. Ugh. I'm sooooo tired. And I have a headache.
Someone just shoot me.
