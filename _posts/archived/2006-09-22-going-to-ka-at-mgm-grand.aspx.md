 [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net),
[Jason](http://www.meyercentral.com/), Jason's brother Adam, and I are
all going to Vegas next weekend for my bachelor party. Come 9:30p on
Saturday the 30th, though, you know where I'll be?

 Front and center for [the Cirque du Soleil show,
*KA*!](http://www.mgmgrand.com/entertainment/ka-cirque-du-soleil-show.aspx)

 Actually, literally front and center. Stu and I, middle of the first
row. Of course, tickets are $150 a piece, so I can't say it didn't cost
me, but I've yet to be disappointed by a Cirque show.

 Oh, *hell yeah*. I'm altogether too stoked. Jenn is going to be *soooo*
jealous.
