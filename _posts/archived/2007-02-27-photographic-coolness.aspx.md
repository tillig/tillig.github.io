Found a couple of cool artists over at [Boing
Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/26/robot_flapper_pinup_.html).

Scott of "Factory 1019"](http://mysite.verizon.net/res0prb3/) does real
photography and digitally enhances it to give it somewhere between a
[*Blade
Runner*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HC2LIK/mhsvortex)
and MC Escher feel. I like a lot of these (though some are NSFW) and
could easily fill my house with them, Jenn notwithstanding.
 
 [Symon Chow](http://www.symonchow.com/) looks like he works in a little
less digitally-modified photography, but is still very cool. It reminds
me a little of
[*Carnivale*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002YLC1U/mhsvortex).
