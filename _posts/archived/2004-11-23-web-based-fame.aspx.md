Some folks get their 15 minutes by starring in movies, writing books, or
singing songs. In my circles, you get your fame from being featured
various spots on the web.
 
 My good friend and co-worker, [Greg](http://www.greghughes.net), got
himself [featured on
Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000293021176/) this morning.
It's cool to see folks you know, particularly friends, with their name
in the proverbial lights.
 
 I don't get much in the way of web-based fame. I think [my link on the
CodeRush community
site](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/Community.xml) is
about the closest it gets.
 
 Maybe I'll have to work a little harder at that.
