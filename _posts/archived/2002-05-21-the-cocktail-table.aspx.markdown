While on the flight to Vegas, I found, in the
[Skymall](http://www.skymall.com) catalog, this [really cool cocktail
table with a clock face under the glass
top](http://www.skymall.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/gotoPage?dept=5418&sid=86854642%400&vid=32124263&page=detail&pid=13670706).
 
 Now, I've had quite a time trying to find a table that I like enough to
buy and put in my living room. I did, once, a long time ago at [The
Bombay Company](http://www.bombayco.com/), but it was on clearance
(presumedly because it was discontinued) and I have never seen it since.
Now that I've found this one, I'm latching on, and I'm gonna buy it. The
problem is price.
 
 See, Skymall's got it for \$599, which I don't think includes shipping.
I've called around locally and I've heard prices that range from \$670
to \$800. I'm pretty sure the Skymall price doesn't count shipping,
which I'm sure is what's going to kill me off since the table weighs
like 90 pounds. We'll see what happens.
 
 On another note, I've got tickets via my work to see the new Star Wars
movie. I'll be going on Thursday at 10. Seems the company has rented out
two theater rooms to see this thing, which is cool. I'm doing my best
not to get my hopes up. Folks have said it's better than Episode I, but
I'll wait to pass judgment.
