Or, more precisely, "Oscar *Contest* Winner."

 That's me.

 My friend Liz has a contest she runs every year where she sends out
ballots to a group of folks and we get to vote on who we think is gonna
win the Oscars. I must be *freaking psychic* because I got the most
right. Which means I won a gift card to [Hollywood
Video](http://www.hollywoodvideo.com/).

 In case you were wondering, yes, **I *am* the man**.

 Yesterday I downloaded some software called
[MixMeister](http://www.mixmeister.com) that allows you to take music in
just about any format (MP3, WAV, etc.) and mix it like a DJ - either
just fade one song into the other or actually do beat mixing where you
change the tempo at the end of one song and at the beginning of the next
and mix them together in a continuous track. It also allows you to do
overlay tracks (like little sounds or whatever that you want to mix into
a song). Once you've got your mix, you can burn it to a CD or even
webcast it. It's pretty cool. Give it a look.

 My [Tron action
figures](http://www.emerchandise.com/browse/TRON/ACTIONFI/) have shipped
from [eMerchandise.com](http://www.emerchandise.com) so I'm hoping
they'll be home when I get there. I think I'm going to set up a Tron
display at work on my desk. That'd rock. One thing about the
eMerchandise site, though - when I went back just now to check on what
Tron stuff they had, I noticed they had *doubled their prices* on the
Tron stuff across the board. I bought the figures for $4.45 each; now
they're *$8.45*. The light cycles were $8.45, now they're *$16.95*.
For the figures, that's a bit of a rip-off; you can get those at
[SunCoast](http://www.suncoast.com) for like $6. But the light cycles
are still $8 cheaper at eMerchandise than they are at SunCoast.

 I got forwarded an email today from my friend Mike. The subject line
was "Travis is a dad!" His comment at the top of the message was, "Dude!
I saw the subject of this email, before I saw the sender, and it scared
me!" Me, too, man, since it would have to be, like, the Immaculate
Conception or something. According to the email, the "baby's got
Travis's head." Scary. I don't think I wanna see a baby with my head on
it.

 Jenn's parents come back from Disneyland today. They asked me what I
wanted, and I said I wanted a *big* [Cheshire
Cat](http://disney.go.com/desktopstop/alice/pictures/preview3.html),
like the gigantic animals you see in the Disney Store. I thought that'd
be awesome, the Cat being my favorite character. Well, apparently they
don't *make* big Cheshire Cats (figures), so I'm SOL. Which probably
also means that they didn't bring me anything *else* back, either. I
guess we'll see, eh? If not, I sure hope they don't think *I'm* bringing
*them* anything from *my* vacations, either. Turnabout's fair play, and
all that.

 Oh, and for the record, **Alice is a *total hottie.*** I'd take her
*any day of the week* over any of the so-called "Disney Princesses."
Snow White? Bah. Cinderella? I think not. It's *all about Alice.*
