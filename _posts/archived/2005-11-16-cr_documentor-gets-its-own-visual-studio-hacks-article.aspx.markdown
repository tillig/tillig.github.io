[Previously](/archive/2005/11/03/cr_documentor-appears-on-visual-studio-hacks.aspx)
the [CR\_Documentor
plugin](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
made its way into the [Visual Studio
Hacks](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/) site in an article called
"[Ask The Pros: Visual Studio .NET
Addins](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/atpAddins)." Today it makes it
in with its [*own dedicated
article*](http://www.visualstudiohacks.com/CRDocumentor). That totally
rocks!
 
 I noted in the article that one of the downsides of CR\_Documentor
mentioned is the lack of support for included files. Not to worry; I've
been noodling on how to make this work in a performant fashion. Not
forgotten, just not quite here yet. There are other things I want to
add, too, like the little gray box that shows the method signature in
the doc and so forth. We'll see what we can do.
 
 Something the article doesn't mention is the context menu that gets
added to the code editor with CR\_Documentor. It adds a lot of helpful
commands that allow you to expand/collapse the XML comment blocks in
your document, convert text blocks into XML comments, XML encode
selected text, and insert XML comment block templates (among other
things).
 
 If you haven't already, [check out
CR\_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor---the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx).
