I went out to get the mail last night and found a used condom wrapper in
the middle of my damn lawn. How the hell did that get there? I mean, are
there illicit sex acts occurring in my yard that I'm not getting to
participate in or something?

 Regardless, picking up condom wrappers out of your yard is a humbling
experience. You really don't want to touch it, so you kind of get a
stick... and push it around for a while until you realize you can't pick
it up with a single stick, so you cast about for a second stick... then
you go into the garage and get a shovel...

 It also makes you feel like you're living in some sort of anarchic
post-apocalyptic Blade Runner world. Come on, man - rubber wrapper in
the suburban yard? *Come on*.

 I guess I should be thankful it wasn't like a used hypodermic needle or
something. The worst I get is a dog turd *in the middle of the sidewalk*
(that was last week) or a condom wrapper in my yard. Lots of shoveling
going on around my place.

 Next time I'll take photos. I'm actually having some digital camera
problems right now (the problem is that it fucking chews through
batteries like a pack of hyenas through a herd of sick wildebeests) so
I'm not taking a load of pictures of, well, anything. I plan on getting
a new, more battery-friendly camera (hopefully more portable, too), at
which time I'll probably go apeshit with the photos and start taking
pictures of random shit again.
