 I'm glad I don't have to do anything tonight, because after last
night's *Mamma Mia!* outing and the *Jet Lag* outing the night before,
to be honest, I'm beat and would just like to stay home and read my
book.
 
 The class continues to go well, and I think we're back on easy street
after yesterday's lesson. I still feel pretty good about all this, so
I'm kind of pumped to start working with the practice tests and see how
I do. I hope the practice tests are accurate representations of the real
thing.
 
 I've informed my instructor that if I'm not here tomorrow it's because
I won the [Powerball](http://www.oregonlottery.org/night/power.shtml)
jackpot. I've got my ticket and now it's time for them to draw my
numbers. Can't win if you don't play, right?

 I've figured out how to get the web server log from the web server I'm
hosted on, but it seems they only record *errors* (i.e., file not found)
in their log, not *successes*. So I can see that some folks still try to
hit images and things that don't reside on my site, but I can't see what
my traffic level is.
 
 Which just fucking figures.
 
 So. I guess I have the option of putting stupid page counters on my
pages or... Or I don't know what else.

 Breaktime.
 
 I'm feeling pretty confident the further we go into this stuff. It's
really feeling like a bit of review, which I hope is a good sign come
test-time. Not having taken any of the Microsoft tests yet, I'm still a
little wary that there will be a multiple choice question with a wrong
answer, a right answer, and a *Microsoft answer*. I feel good that I
could probably pick the right answer, but no promises that it'll be the
Microsoft answer.
 
 Jenn got a shirt at *Mamma Mia!* last night that, unfortunately, is not
the right size (they only had one size, so we figured we'd give it a
go), but luckily my mom is going to see the show tonight and is going to
pick up a different shirt (if they have a better size) so Jenn does not
go shirtless.
 
 Not that I complain when Jenn goes shirtless, but... well, you get the
point. Heh.
 
 It's looking like I'm going to have to go with something like [eXTeMe
Tracking](http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/?home) to get site stats.
Blarg.

 Aw, shucks. We're getting out early. Well, I guess that's it for me!
