This was seen in the parking lot this morning. Apparently this is not
uncommon for this particular vehicle:

 ![I can't figure out
reverse]({{ site.url }}/images/20040916taotw.jpg)

 This person is why many parking lots have signs that say "head-in
parking only." Some folks still haven't taken that class on how to park,
the advanced stage of which is "how to use reverse in combination with
mirrors to ensure you're actually in a parking spot." This is no
exception.

 I am ashamed to work at a company where people *believe this is okay*.
