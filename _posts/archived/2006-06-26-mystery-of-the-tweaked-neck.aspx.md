I had this huge - I mean *huge* - post about this awesome party Jenn and
I went to for our friend Tracy where we all dressed up and [solved a
murder mystery](http://www.freeformgames.com/game_details.php?21). I
talked about all of my issues getting clothing (it was a formal affair)
and things I liked and disliked about the whole thing (net result - I
thought it was cool, but folks needed to stay more in character)... but
I have [these Goddamn "browser
buttons"](http://www.newrecruit.org/archives/2003/january/firstreviewof)
on my keyboard and I bumped one and entirely lost the post. All of it.
So I'm not retyping the thing since I don't have time. Just imagine that
you read a reasonably entertaining description of a murder mystery
party. Tracy, accept my apologies for a less-than-thorough write-up.
 
 I am currently in the process of disabling those fuckers.
 
 So Saturday night was the party, and it was cool. Jenn looked great, I
looked great, and it was hella fun. Even though it was hot like nothing
describable. Death heat.
 
 Sunday morning I woke up at 5:45a with this ridiculous tweak in my
neck. Some Vicodin and a few Advil *only took the edge off*. It was
*horrible*. All day long I was totally useless (not that that's
different than most other Sundays) and was tired and headachey. Today I
can at least get around, but it does still hurt. Hopefully it'll be gone
by the weekend. I think it was triggered by the
