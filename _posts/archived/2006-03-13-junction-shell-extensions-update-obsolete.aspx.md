[Hermann Schinagl has a great shell
extension](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html)
that provides oodles of functionality around junctions. [I have a
similar extension](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx),
but while mine is more of a "visual cue" sort of thing, his actually
*does something*. I dropped him a note, and he just integrated my icon
overlay, and I'm gathering that he's going to put the property sheet in,
too, when he gets time. **[UPDATE: As of March 26, 2007, Hermann has
integrated the property sheet into his extension. Woohoo!]**

 [Check this thing
out](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html)
- it's the bomb. Plus, once he's got the property sheet in there, it
totally obsoletes mine. (Of course, I offer the source code to mine, so
for those wanting to learn a little, [go check that
out](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx).)
