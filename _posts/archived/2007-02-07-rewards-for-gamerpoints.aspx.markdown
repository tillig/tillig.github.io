Now *this* is what I'm talking about. Being a Gamerpoint Whore, I'm all
about getting achievements on Xbox 360. Wouldn't it be cool if you
actually got something for the points?

 On February 12, visit
[http://www.xbox.com/rewards](http://www.xbox.com/rewards) and register.
You'll be placed in an "experience category" based on your Gamerscore at
the time of entry. Then if you can raise your Gamerscore by 1500 points
between February 12 and April 12, you get a reward (MS points, a shirt,
a game... lots of different prizes).
 
 Check out [Gamerscore
Blog](http://gamerscoreblog.com/team/archive/2007/02/06/540799.aspx) and
[the Xbox
site](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/news/2007/0205-xboxrewards.htm)
for more details. I'm totally in.
