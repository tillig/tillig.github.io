I started playing *[Medal of Honor:
Frontline](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V6BB/mhsvortex)*
last night, and let me say, thus far it's everything I could have hoped
for. The stuff I had issues with on the demo disc I played was all dealt
with. The menu interface is cool, the missions are cool, the whole thing
is just... cool. I need to show my dad; he's into the WWII period stuff
and I think he'd dig it, too.
 
 The more I listen to the [Kylie CD I
bought](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y228/mhsvortex),
the more I like it. And, again, it doesn't hurt that she's a hottie. I
played it for Jenn and she likes it, too, but she thinks the Kylie pix
inside look trashy. I dunno... a little bit of trashy is always welcome
in my book. (Jenn has a Zero-Trashy Policy that is a little
disappointing at times, but that's just the way she is. Maybe I can wear
her down...?)
 
 Not to be insensitive, but is anyone else tired of hearing about the
[two missing Oregon City
girls](http://www.oregons12.com/news/local/story.asp?content_id=1230650)?
Really, I'm sorry that they're gone, and if there *was* something I
could do about it, I would. But since there's not, can you stop
inundating me with it? I suppose the same feeling goes for the whole
September 11th thing - I'm really sorry that it happened; it was very
tragic. But it's *over now* and it's *time to move on*. Watching a
"feature" story on the news about "how America's coping since September
11th" every month is not helping. Maybe that's just me.
 
 I guess some idiot stole like \$12,000 worth of [Cirque du
Soleil](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com) costumes a couple of days ago
from their tent here in Portland. That's just wonderful promotion for
the arts, right there. I don't know this person, but I think I hate
them. Just irritating. Besides, where do they think they're going to
sell these stolen costumes? It's not like the corner shop makes them;
anyone who sees these things are going to know *exactly* where they came
from. What a dumbass.
