The more I work in tech, and the more I write in this blog, I'm finding
that I write more about work/tech stuff and less about what I've been up
to. The thing is, what I'm usually up to *is* tech stuff.

 I'm not sure how my readers feel about this (or even if I have any
readers other than the Google search bots) because you gang out there
don't comment. Not that I'm soliciting comments for comments' sake, mind
you, I'm just sort of going by intuition here.

 I'm pondering the idea of splitting out my tech-related stuff into a
fully separate blog. That would allow the folks coming for the tech to
see what they want and the folks trying to keep up with me personally to
see what they want, ne'er the twain shall meet.

 Again, though, the problem is that what I'm usually up to *is* tech,
which means the people who want to know what I'm doing should probably
just assume, should I split the two, that I'm simply busy with work
things that you really wouldn't care about.

 Any opinions on that?

 I'm also thinking of creating a more static "downloads" section for the
little programs I'm throwing up here. Not that I think I'm going to have
some massive load of software to download, but I figure it might make it
easier for the folks coming for the downloads to have a nice, central
spot that has the latest info in a less bloggy format.

 Questions? Comments?
