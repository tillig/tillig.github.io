Typemock has released a new package for unit testing ASP.NET which
includes their Isolator mocking product and an add-on called "Ivonna"
that lets you mock a full ASP.NET request lifecycle without running the
page through a web server.

As part of the launch, they're giving away free licenses. [Check out how
to get yours
