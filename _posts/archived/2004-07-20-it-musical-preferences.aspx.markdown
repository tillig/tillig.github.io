Saw [this](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/20/1326207) posted
over at Slashdot and figured it was interesting enough to comment on:
The [musical preferences of IT-related
personnel](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/20/musical_preference_survey/).
 
 I am a Microsoft-certified professional developer and database
administrator. According to the survey, then, I should be listening to
mainstream pop music, heavy metal, and indie rock. Hmmm. While I do
listen to some mainstream pop, I'm not a big heavy metal fan. I dig the
indie rock, but if I had to choose, I'd say I'm more a
techno/electronica listener than anything else, which, according to the
survey, makes me a Linux user.
 
 I guess that just goes to show that I don't quite fit the stereotype.
 
 I also find it odd that they didn't list "Mac user" as one of the
categories. Maybe they don't consider Macintosh users as IT-related
people. Interesting.
