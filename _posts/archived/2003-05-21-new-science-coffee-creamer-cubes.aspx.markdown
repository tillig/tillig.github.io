Okay, here's an idea for you: non-dairy coffee creamer that comes in
*cubes*. Sort of like sugar cubes, but powdered creamer. Easily
stackable, so you don't have the "bowl full of cream containers" that
those plastic cup-like things cause you. Waste free, so you're not
wasting the paper on packets of powdered creamer. Convenient - you don't
have to scoop or pour the creamer, you just drop a couple creamer cubes
into your coffee and you're set. Each cube would be the equivalent of
one of the packets of creamer or one of the little plastic containers of
cream. You could even wrap each cube in a dissolving coating, sort of
like pharmaceutical tablets, so you wouldn't get the "crumbling" effect
that you get with a box of sugar cubes (where the last few cubes aren't
even full cubes anymore).
 
 I'm obviously in the wrong line of work. They should pay me to work in
a think tank and come up with brilliance like this all day.
