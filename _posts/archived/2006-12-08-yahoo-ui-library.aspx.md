I realize I'm probably the last to get on the boat with this one, but I
came across the [Yahoo! UI Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)
this morning and it's pretty cool stuff. It's an open-source set of UI
components for creating rich web applications. Items I know I've had to
write that are included:

- [CSS-based grid layouts](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/)
- [Client-side JavaScript logging for debugging and
    testing](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/)
- [Client-side tabbed
    content](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/)

 They have a lot of other neat stuff, too, like menu controls,
treeviews, animation libraries... it's pretty slick. I'm going to have
to play around with this and see how it works. It looks promising.
