The weekends, lately, have generally brought with them yard work.
Several people, including my parents, impart pithy phrases like "Welcome
to the joys of being a home owner!" when I say this, but I think they're
missing the point:

 I don't think the yard work is necessarily all that bad. I'd much
rather do the yard than have to put up with neighbors in attached units
who double park you in or smell like freshly pissed pants. Yard work is
a cake walk in comparison, and I am *happy* to do it if that's the price
I must pay for dwelling independence.

 Anyway, yard work. We've been killing/pulling the weeds, then putting
down anti-weed cloth in the flower beds that, hopefully soon, will be
barkdusted over. Unfortunately, the nice weather is primarily during the
week, so on the weekend, when there's time to actually do the work,
we're constrained to a couple of hours prior to the rain setting in. A
little at a time isn't hurting us, but it'd be nice to really just make
some *progress*.

 In other news, for insurance purposes I've been cataloging my comic
book collection with
[ComicsPriceGuide.com](http://www.comicspriceguide.com/). Just from a
curiosity perspective, it's interesting to see the stats it's coming up
with, like the publisher I have the most comics from (so far it's Dark
Horse). Very keen.

 I haven't heard from the TV folks on what the story is with the TV
"buyout" going on, but I'm starting to investigate what's out on the
market as far as TVs are concerned. It's a toss-up between LCD and DLP,
and in the LCD arena it's more of an "LCD rear-projection" than an "LCD
direct-view" sort of thing because giant LCD panels are a little
cost-prohibitive at the moment. Pending on how long I can push out the
purchase, maybe the price will go down. That said, not having a TV in
the main room is sort of a pain.
