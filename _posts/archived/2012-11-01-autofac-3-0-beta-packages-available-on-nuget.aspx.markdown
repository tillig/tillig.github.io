We're super close to having a final release of Autofac 3.0 with support
for Windows Store apps and Windows Phone 8. **Beta packages are
available on NuGet now.** Rather than repeat what Alex has already said,
[go check out his very detailed explanation of all the new/fixed/updated
stuff
available](http://alexmg.com/post/2012/11/01/Autofac-30-Beta-packages-available-on-NuGet.aspx).
