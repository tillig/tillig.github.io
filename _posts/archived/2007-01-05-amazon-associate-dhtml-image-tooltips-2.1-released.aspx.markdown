This latest adds support for the DHTML tooltip script to co-exist with
the Amazon "link-enhancer" script that has been released. The Amazon
script takes precedence; links that have been modified by the Amazon
script will be bypassed by the DHTML tooltip script. Tooltips that
explicitly make use of the DHTML tooltip script will still function
properly, and Amazon links not modified by the Amazon "link-enhancer"
script will still be updated by the DHTML tooltip script as always.
