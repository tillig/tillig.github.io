Finally completed *Grand Theft Auto 4* 100% this morning!

![Key To The City: You completed GTA IV to
100%]({{ site.url }}/images/20080827gta4_100.png)

Pretty stoked about that. Turns out the last bits I had to do, [as I
suspected](/archive/2008/08/25/gta4-95-tropic-thunder.aspx), was to take
my friends out to do all the activities.

I also got the "Walk Free" achievement this morning - escaping a
four-star wanted level alive. Secret to that one is to land a helicopter
in the embassy and get outÂ (instant four-star wanted level), then fly
the helicopter to a secluded beach in the north where there's a boat.
Get in the boat and just avoid the other boats, which isn't too hard.
Might try for some of the others, like "One Man Army" (survive five
minutes with six-star wanted level), but generally, after 80 hours, I'm
pretty much done. I love the game, had a great time with it,
***definitely*** got my money's worth, but there are other games I have
- games I got *for Christmas last year* - that I need to get to.
