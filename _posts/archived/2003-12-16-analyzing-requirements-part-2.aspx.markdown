God *damn* this class is boring!
 
 The most frustrating thing I'm running into is a distinct lack of
quality assurance on the coursework for the class. We have labs (more
like essay questions) at the end of each chapter that we go through, but
they all end up like this:
 
 Q: Company X is releasing a web site for online ordering. They want it
secure and reliable. They want to make sure only registered users can
purchase things. What are the user requirements?
 
 Now, for those who haven't sat through this, "user requirements" are
essentially "requirements for what the end user will see." The end user
doesn't necessarily see "security" or "reliability" - those are
"operational requirements." So the answer in the *real world* to this
question is, "There are no user requirements specified."
 
 The real answer?
 
 A: Web site users should be able to complete their orders in five
minutes or less.
 
 ***WHAT?!***
 
 Where did that five minute requirement come from? You didn't see it
either? Fuckin' A.
 
 Anyway, that's where I'm at. It's boring, nothing else to say. Moving
on.
