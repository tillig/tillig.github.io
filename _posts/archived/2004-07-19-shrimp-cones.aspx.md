We beer-battered some shrimp last night (I'm not really a beer drinker,
so it's good to find something to do with the leftover beer from our
housewarming party), and it was pretty tasty.

 I got to thinking it might be a faster/better idea if we just had a
huge vat of oil for the frying, then battered all the shrimp and just
dumped them in at the same time. Jenn said that would make them all
stick together and come out in a big ball. Then it hit me: *shrimp
cones*.

 Get all the beer-battered shrimp to come out in a huge shrimp ball.
Then make cones out of hush-puppy and throw the ball on top. Voila!
Shrimp cones. Top with cocktail sauce and serve.
