Remember the Space Pen I lost a while ago so I ended up buying a new
one? Yeah, well, I found the one I lost. It was in my car, under the
seat, between the floor mat and the metal track that the seat sits on.
Since it's dark down there, the track is black, the carpet's black, and
the pen's black, I didn't see it. But I dropped a quarter in there, and
when I reached in to get it, there was the pen. So now I have two Space
Pens, which isn't a bad thing.
