I'm sensitive to smells.

I think I get it from my mom, who is also sensitive to smells, though
she really likes*strong perfumes* and scents whereas I really can't
stand *anything of volume*. I can't really walk down the soap aisle at
the store and I'm not a big fan of scented laundry soap or fabric
softener. In most cases, *I'd rather things just not have a smell*.

There are exceptions, of course. I like the smell of chocolate. I like
the smell of coffee. I also like the smell of pipe tobacco that you get
when you walk past the smoke shop, but I don't want to be in the middle
of a bunch of pipe smokers.

Anyway, this is all coming to mind because the entire first floor at
work smells like *god damn hot ham sandwich* and it's making me sort of
ill.

My cubicle neighbors are probably irritated with me and my smell issue
since it basically means if you cook last night's stank-ass fish dinner
and bring it back to your desk, you'll probably be getting a polite
knock on the wall of your cube with my smiling face ready to have a
polite discussion about *maybe please could you keep the cooked food in
the break area thanks*.

I think smelly food falls into that same respect-for-your-neighbors
arena as nail clipping. If you need to clip your nails, go ahead and
take that into the appropriate place (restroom) so you're not bugging
other people with it.

I recently moved my cube not too far from the original location so I
could get a nice view of the outside world rather than being stuck in a
dark windowless tank all day. It's a nice location, reasonably quiet,
with a view of the parking lot which is really not so bad if I do say so
myself. Unfortunately, what I did find is that the air vent over my head
is, through some dark magic, connected to the vent over the break area,
so whenever someone's got something luscious a-cookin', it ends up
blowing out the vent in the ceiling right into my face.

I'm not entirely sure what to do about that. I have done some
experimentation to see if this really is the case, and, yes, it does
appear to be so. If it starts stinkin', I can jog over to the break area
and, sure enough, there's the microwave going.

While I am figuring out how to somehow alleviate the issue at the
source, I have "rigged up" a sort of counter-stink defense involving a
small desk fan and "Clean Linen" scented air freshener. Step 1: Turn on
fan. Step 2: Spray into the fan. Step 3: Sigh in relief.

Thank goodness for laptops, right? "Ack! They released the mustard gas!
Grab your laptop and hide out in a conference room until it dissipates!"

Work's not the only place with some dicey smells.
[Babies](/archive/2010/12/01/phoenix-aeralynn-illig.aspx) bring with
them a whole new set of unpleasant aromas, most of which involve poop or
vomit, and sometimes both. I am partial to neither, and that makes for a
challenge. I'm not sure who figured out what baby formula is supposed to
smell like, but *that guy needs to be fired*. Baby formula, even fresh
in the bottle, smells like ass. Come on, you couldn't stick some vanilla
scent in there or something? Oh, and the Auntie Anne's pretzel stand at
the mall always smells so sickeningly sweet it catches my breath.

OK, the ham sandwich appears to be dying down. I can probably take this
mask off and get back to work.
