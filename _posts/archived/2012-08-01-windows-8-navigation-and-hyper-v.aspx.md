I had a tiny breakdown yesterday where I *finally* got Windows 8
installed (on a Hyper-V VM) and hit a massive "[someone moved my
cheese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F)" moment
where I basically couldn't figure out how to do anything. The Windows
key wasn't doing anything, I couldn't figure out just the right spot to
right-click... *bad times*. My Google-fu totally failed me, too.

This morning, with a fresh set of eyes, suddenly looking for the same
search terms yielded two super-helpful articles. For those in the same
[late] boat as me...

-   "[Getting Around in Windows
    8](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowsexperience/archive/2012/03/08/getting-around-in-windows-8.aspx)"
    tells you where your cheese went.
-   "[Windows 8 Key Combinations Inside of
    Hyper-V](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2012/05/03/windows-8-key-combinations-inside-of-hyper-v.aspx)"
    tells you how to get the Windows key (and other key combinations) to
    work right.
