I don't really remember what I did on Friday night. I think I worked on
the vest for my Wonka costume, but I don't recall, which sort of implies
that it was inconsequential seeing as how I wasn't actually inebriated.
 
 Saturday I took my car in for its 40,000 mile checkup. I was told when
I scheduled the appointment that it'd take a couple of hours, so I
scheduled it early (8:40a) and Jenn drove her car to the dealership to
pick me up after I dropped my car off so we could cruise around that
side of town, burn a couple of hours, and get my car when it was done.
 
 We ended up going to probably three different malls, just wandering,
and I picked up some [Wonka TV Room
Goggles](http://www.drpeepers.com/licensed/wwonka.html), which fit over
my glasses perfectly. I was wondering what I was going to do about my
glasses, now I have an answer.
 
 Long about 1:00p or so I was wondering what happened to my car, so I
called the dealership and found out they'd "have it done by 4:00p, as
scheduled." What? Two hours suddenly turned into eight. That's... that's
great.
 
 Jenn and I ended up checking out
[*Flightplan*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/), which is a decent
film, if a bit of a one-trick pony. By the time that finished, my car
was ready, so we picked that up and headed home.
 
 Saturday night was spent feverishly working on my Wonka vest. I got it
very nearly done, but at 1:00a I had to go to bed.
 
 Sunday [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net/Blog/) and Tif came over.
Stu and I [played
bongos](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007XS1HY/mhsvortex)
while Tif and Jenn washed their cars.
 
 At one point, Stu and I went to the store and while I was parking I ran
over a (new) package of diapers that someone kindly left behind in the
parking space for me. Normally I'd not mention such a thing except that
the plastic packaging from the diapers melted to some piece or other on
the undercarriage of my car and now when I drive it smells like burning
plastic. I'm going to have to get under there when I get home tonight
and scrape that off.
 
 Oh, and I came up with a new look for my site, so I'll be implementing
that soon. If you come in and something's messed up, that's probably why
- I don't think it's going to be an atomic commit.
