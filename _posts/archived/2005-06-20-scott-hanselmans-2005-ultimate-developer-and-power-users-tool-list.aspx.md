Looks like [Scott's posted his updated tool
list](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,cbb7f3df-b9dd-4a4a-8cc6-83d87c117d26.aspx),
and there's some great stuff on there if I do say so myself.

 I noticed I got a shout-out, which is all too kind of him, and a few of
my tools made it on the list, including:

[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)

[SNInfo](/archive/2005/02/07/sninfo-strong-naming-info-for-.net-assemblies.aspx)

[Fusion Log Settings
Changer](/archive/2004/10/20/fusion-log-viewer-settings-changer.aspx)

[Junction Icon
Overlay](/archive/2005/04/20/junction-shell-extensions.aspx)

[.NET Command Prompt
Everywhere](/archive/2004/06/28/.net-command-prompt-here.-and-everywhere-else.aspx)

 If you like those, check out the rest of the [Software/Downloads
category](/) for other stuff I've got. My content here isn't always
technical in nature, but sometimes I can pull out a good code snippet or
two.
