I've been wanting to move to a .NET based blog package for a while now.
I'm currently on pMachine, an old, PHP-based freeware product that isn't
architected super well and is hard to customize or extend. I'm a .NET
guy now and it'd be nice to be able to do some cool .NET things on my
site, so I'd like a .NET blog.
 
 I started looking at [dasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net/), but I don't
think that's the way for me. It's got some nice features, but the code
on the back end was inherited, patched, fixed, updated, added to, and
jimmied together to make it what it is today. It's not terribly well
documented, and looking at how it works from a code perspective is less
than clear. Even just trying to install it locally to see if I liked it
wasn't too straightforward and ended with me talking to a couple of
other dasBlog users who had this odd proprietary knowledge that they got
from still other dasBlog users. I can't be dealing with that.
 
 [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net) and I thought we might just start
writing our own blog engine. We went so far as to get a domain name and
a project space on SourceForge, but the time required to get the thing
going is a little more than we've had to allocate to it.
 
 Now I'm really thinking about Subtext, though. [With the 1.9
release](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/31/Subtext_1.9_quotDaedelusquot_Released.aspx),
they've updated to .NET 2.0, they're getting their unit test coverage
up, and from what I can tell, the templates use user controls (like
master pages) so I wouldn't have to deal with the odd template/macro
language that most blog engines make use of. I'm all about that.
 
 Granted, I haven't actually downloaded it and looked at it yet to see
if it's any better than dasBlog behind the scenes. But I like what I've
seen so far.
