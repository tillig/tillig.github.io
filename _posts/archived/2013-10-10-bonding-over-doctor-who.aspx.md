I admit, I have sort of a love-hate relationship with my toddler. I love
her so much and she's so cute and friendly and fun... when she's in a good
mood. When she's in a bad mood, or doing her "testing boundaries" thing,
I want to *throttle her*.

Where I'm going with that is that I look for things that we can both
enjoy together â€“ activities we can sort of "bond" over, where we're both
having a good time. Sometimes this means [racing hippity-hop
balls](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DFTWSV2?tag=mhsvortex) around the
house, but I can't really run around for hours (or let her ride my back
for hours) like she wants, so finding "quieter" activities is good.

Jenn usually gives Phoe her phone on the way home from day care so Phoe
can pick whatever she wants to watch from Netflix. Phoe has now taken to
watching *[Doctor
Who](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0089AD8IO?tag=mhsvortex)* of her own
volition. She'll scroll around and look for it.

So the new quiet activity now is watching*Doctor Who* together. "Daddy,
I watch Doctor with you. We watch Doctor together." Yes, yes we will.

I'll get her a cup of juice, get myself a Coke or something, and we'll
sit down and watch an episode. She'll reach her cup over and go,
"Cheers!" and we'll clink together and drink.

She likes to point out the characters. "That's the Doctor, Daddy." Yes,
that's the Doctor. "That's Martha. She doctor, too." Yes, Martha's a
doctor, too, but not the same kind of doctor. (We're heading out of
third season into fourth.) "Oh, Daddy, he bad guy. Doctor need stop the
bad guy." The Doctor will get him, honey. You know he will. "Cheers!"
*\*clink\**

And when one episode ends: "We watch that again, Daddy!" Good girl. My
job here is done.
