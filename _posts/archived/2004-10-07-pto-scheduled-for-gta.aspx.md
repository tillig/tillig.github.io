I just scheduled - and got approved - my week of luxurious paid time off
duing the first week of November for...
 
 Wait for it...
 
 [**Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas!**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001VGFK2/mhsvortex)
 
 That's right! The *entire* first week of November, my vacation in San
Andreas begins. I will be sitting on the couch, eating junk food,
sitting next to my 16-pound fat cat (who likes to lay around next to
people playing video games - it's my Tubby Game Cat), doing drive-by
shootings and robberies. Living the life of Grand Theft Auto.
 
 I *seriously* can't wait.
