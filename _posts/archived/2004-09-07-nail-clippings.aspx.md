Add one to my [long] list of pet peeves:

 *I **cannot stand it** when people clip their nails at work.*

 I'll accept it if you have to fix a hangnail or something, but if you
feel the need to deal with your nails at your desk, step back and take a
long toke off the reality reefer: No one wants to hear your stupid nails
being clipped, nor do they want to step in/sit in/touch the clippings
that are no doubt flying all over your cubicle.

 We have restrooms for personal grooming. Better still, try dealing with
things like that *at home*. That clip-clip-clip sound coming over the
wall is worse than scraping on a chalkboard. Do something about it.
