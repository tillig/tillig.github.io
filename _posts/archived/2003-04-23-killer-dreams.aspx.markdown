I had this dream the other night that [Greg
Brady](http://www.barrywilliams.net/) was a serial killer and I was the
next victim.
 
 The thing about it is, I don't know if it was a movie I was watching in
my dream, or if that was just the dream. Around the time that I was
going to find out, Jenn got up to pee, then came back and started a fit
of sneezing. Halfway through the sneezing fit, the cat started crying
really loud outside the door and decided it would be a good idea to just
stand in the middle of the [Sofa
Scram](http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_Display.cfm?siteid=1&pCatId=3455)
mat so the alarm would just stay on. She doesn't like the sound of the
mat, but I think she realizes the humans don't like it, either.
 
 Fucking cat.
 
 When I have weird dreams like that, Jenn and I will compare in the
morning to see whose dream was weirder. But it's no contest; when Jenn
dreams, she dreams "realistic" - only stuff that could actually happen.
