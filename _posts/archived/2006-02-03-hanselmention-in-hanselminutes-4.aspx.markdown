Got a brief mention in the [fourth installment of
Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=5) with
respect to Watir and Ruby test integration with NUnit. For those looking
for more on this, check out my
[Paraesthesia.Test.Ruby](/archive/2006/01/13/paraesthesia.test.ruby-integrating-nunit-with-rubywatir-unit-tests.aspx)
library. You can [download the
code](/archive/2006/01/13/paraesthesia.test.ruby-integrating-nunit-with-rubywatir-unit-tests.aspx)
or read [the article on
CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/cpnet/RubyTestExecutor.asp) that
I wrote discussing how the integration was done.
