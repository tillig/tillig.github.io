Not a lot has gone on lately, so I haven't updated the site. For some
reason, writing out how I watched syndicated reruns of [*Everybody Loves
Raymond*](http://www.everybodylovesray.com) and had chili dogs for
dinner doesn't sound like something I need to do. But now you know, so
stop complaining.
 
 I went to lunch yesterday at my friend Colin's house. I mentioned him
in my [last
post](/archive/2002/12/16/spiffarias-home-of-the-brown-lettuce.aspx)
when I was talking about how I really can't stand little kids but his
kids are cool. Anyway, went to lunch over there and sort of had a little
bit of my faith in humanity restored.
 
 See, he's got two kids - one's 4 (Peter) and the other's 1.5 (Tim). I
think. I'm guessing at the ages because, well, I don't remember these
things (hey, it takes me a while to remember how old *I* am). Normally,
I would not be amused by the antics or the things kids like this say and
do. But certain things struck me.
 
 For example, Colin's wife, Kathy, was talking to me and telling me that
Peter was "acting out" and she couldn't figure out what was going on.
Turns out, what she called "acting out" was him doing things like
talking out of turn and not being polite. (Obviously I wasn't there all
day, but that's what I saw.) Now, I don't know about you, but that's
something I just assume a little kid like that will do. But it seems
that can be controlled, and I find that very interesting.
 
 Another thing: Peter was eating lunch and asked "May I please be
excused to go potty?" Huh? Jenn's niece usually just mumbles something
incoherent that rhymes with "bathroom" and then whines a little and runs
for the toilet. This was *perfect English* I was hearing. Unbelievable!
 
 This all started me thinking, and I'd like to bring forth my (now very
solid) belief: **One of the prime reasons children in this country are
gibbering idiots is bad parenting.**
 
 That's right, bad parenting. It seems to me, at least by looking at
these two tykes, that if you pay attention to your kids and teach them
well, they may just act like the responsible human beings they're
supposed to be.
 
 I'm not saying there's no issue with the school system or anything
else, but I think this is pretty conclusive evidence that it begins in
the home and trickles out from there. Even if you have a pretty crappy
school, you can at least grow up with the basics and some good common
sense if you have a good parental environment.
 
 I was considering writing an open letter to parents everywhere, right
here in the blog. I may still. But for now, let's leave it at that.
