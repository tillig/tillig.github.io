Lots of stuff getting upgraded. Let's see...
 
 Jenn's birthday is today, so her age has been upgraded. We'll be
getting together tonight with my parents and her sister and niece.
 
 I got - free from [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) - a [ViewSonic V37
PocketPC](http://www.viewsonic.com/products/pocket_pc_pocketpcv37.htm).
Very nice, if I do say so myself. I've migrated the stuff from my old
Compaq iPaq 3600 onto this new machine and I'm not looking back.
 
 I've installed [pMachine](http://www.pmachine.com) so I can potentially
provide some better blog features for you nameless masses who show up
here to read about me every day. I've just got the base install
complete, no customizations or anything, but I'll be working on setting
that up and getting it *just right*, after which I'll import my blog
entries from here over to there and get you going over there. I think my
templates will change a bit, since I'd like to shake things up. My
current idea is sort of a cobalt blue and black theme a la [*Mulholland
Drive*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKJA/mhsvortex). So
that's getting upgraded.
 
 Speaking of cobalt blue, I somehow lost my [Fisher Space
Pen](http://www.goldspot.com/fisherspacepens.cfm). My favorite pen,
black with a gold "US Ski Team" logo on it (I could have done without
the logo, but the pen itself was *the bomb*. I had it in my pocket
yesterday, and now... nothing. No idea where it went. So I ordered me up
[a new blue one](http://www.goldspot.com/prodView.cfm?partno=400BB),
sort of like something you'd see out of *Mulholland Drive*. It's cool,
and I'm looking forward to getting it. So my pen is getting upgraded
(from "no pen" to "really cool pen").
 
 Finally, I forgot to mention it, but a couple of days ago I broke down
and ordered [my new dining room
table](http://www.searshomecenter.com/homecenter/prod_display1.asp?PRODUCT=33497).
I had found it at a different site, but then at the last minute I saw it
on the Sears web site, for \$55 cheaper. Can't beat that. So my dining
room is getting an upgrade. Of course, that's not going to be here until
October 13 or so. Shipping. Bah.
