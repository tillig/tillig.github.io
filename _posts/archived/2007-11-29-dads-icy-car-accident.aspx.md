[Dad's Car Accident](http://picasaweb.google.com/travis.illig/DadSCarAccident)

My dad was headed to work yesterday and hit an icy patch in the road.
His car spun 180 degrees, went into the ditch, and hit a tree.

He's okay, albeit on some serious pain killers and with some chipped
vertebrae.  No one else was involved or injured and after some physical
therapy and some time to rest up, he should be good as new.

[Here are some pictures of what was left of his
car.](http://picasaweb.google.com/travis.illig/DadSCarAccident)
Absolutely totaled.  He had to climb out the passenger window because
the frame was so bent up neither door would open.

Of course, the thing he seems to be most concerned with is that,
somewhere in the chaos, *he lost his glasses*.  Heh.
