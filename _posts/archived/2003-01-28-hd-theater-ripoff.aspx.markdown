After some quick research, I found two things:

 First, we don't get [Discovery HD Theater](http://dhd.discovery.com/)
in our area by default. That's something you have to special request.

 Second, it [costs like \$5 - \$20 a
month](http://dhd.discovery.com/utilities/getchannel/getchannel.html).
It's a subscription service, not just another cable channel!

 Now, I enjoy my [*Trading
Spaces*](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html)
as much as the next guy, but if I'm going to be paying \$20 a month for
a channel, it'd [best have some boobs on
it](http://www.playboy.com/pbtv-hv/). And I don't mean the scary native
ones you see in [*National
Geographic*](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/).
