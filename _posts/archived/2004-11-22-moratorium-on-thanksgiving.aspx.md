Due to the incompatibility with peoples' schedules, their desires, their
[qualms](/archive/2004/10/26/the-thanksgiving-debate.aspx), and so on,
my family has put a moratorium on Thanksgiving.
 
 Which is to say: nobody's getting together, so *I have a vacation day
all to myself*. Sounds like some Chinese food is in my future. Mmmm...
 
 This is going to be the best Thanksgiving ***ever***. I'm sure I'll be
making my way [back to San
Andreas](/archive/2004/11/02/vacation-in-san-andreas-day-1.aspx) for a
bit, which will be nice since I've only really had time to return on
weekends.
 
 Speaking of San Andreas, [my
shirt](http://store.yahoo.com/rockstarwarehouse/sanandreastee.html)
should be here today. I ordered it last week and I'm anxious for it.
After spending so much time there, it'll be nice to have something that
openly declares it so. I told Jenn I ordered this and she shook her head
like I'd broken some unspoken rule that says I can't be a gamer geek
like the rest of the English speaking world out there. Too bad, baby!
I'm a citizen of San Andreas now!
 
 I also got to play ([San
Andreas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001VGFK2/mhsvortex))
for a while this weekend, which was nice. I finished a few more missions
that opened up the ability for me to fly, so I've been cruising around
in airplanes and helicopters, going back to other places to pick up
money and guns that I normally wouldn't pick up because it's too far
away... but now that I can fly, it's a lot faster. Just take a
helicopter, land in the middle of the street, get what you need, and fly
away. (My favorite flying vehicle is the jetpack - don't leave home
without it!)
 
 I finished the book I was reading,
[*Eragon*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375826688/mhsvortex),
this weekend and it was awesome. [I can't wait for the next
one](http://www.alagaesia.com).
 
 While normally I alternate between fiction and non-fiction/educational
books (I can only really read one book at a time because I forget what's
going on in the various books if I don't stick to one), I've decided to
break that and read another fiction. Next up is [*Lyra's
Oxford*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375828192/mhsvortex) by
Philip Pullman. Admittedly short, but I loved the [*His Dark
Materials*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0440238609/mhsvortex)
trilogy with the same characters, so it'll be nice to see a little more
from that universe.
 
 Saw [*National Treasure*](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/) this
weekend and had a good time with it. Sure, it was totally implausible,
but it was *fun*, so I have to give it high marks. I don't know if I'll
be picking it up on DVD, but it was definitely worth the watch.
