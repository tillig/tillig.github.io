It happened again last night.

Jenn and I decided we'd sit down and watch some of [*Heroes* Season 1 on
HD
DVD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QTD5TS?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000QTD5TS). 
(We were specifically interested in some of the cool special features,
like revealing the hidden helix in each episode and so forth.)  I fired
up the Xbox 360 and noticed there was a dashboard update.  You can't
really decline to take the updates, so I took it.

We got about halfway into the first episode when the screen froze. 
Picture still on the screen, but not moving and no sound coming out.

Well, sometimes crap happens, and I've accepted that.  It's not too
often, and usually a reboot will fix it.  I turned the power off, then
turned it back on and it never got past the startup logo.  Halfway into
the logo it froze again.

I've been through the troubleshooting steps before:

1.  Cycle the power.
2.  If that doesn't fix it, make sure to remove all of the discs in the
    machine and cycle the power.
3.  If that doesn't fix it, disconnect all the peripherals including the
    hard drive and any memory cards and cycle the power.
4.  If that doesn't fix it, leave the peripherals disconnected, unplug
    the console from the wall, wait one minute, plug the console back
    in, and turn it on.
5.  If that doesn't fix it, call support.

I did all that, ended up calling support, and long story short, I'm
sending the console in again because the guy says it sounds like the
system software is hosed.  This part of the support call was the most
awesome:

> **Me:** I can't get past the initial startup logo. It freezes halfway

>  **Me:** No.
>  **Support Guy:** Is the console set to the correct time?
>  **Me:** I'd tell you, but *I can't get past the initial startup
> logo*.
>  **Support Guy:** ...oh.  Right.

This will be my third repair, yielding my fourth console (assuming they
send me another refurb).  [The first
time](/archive/2006/07/24/caketastic-30th.aspx), the console stopped
registering discs in the drive.  That was when I first learned about
[the wacky DRM scheme and the problems you have after
repair](/archive/2006/08/10/xbox-live-arcade-got-drm-all-wrong.aspx). 
The second time, [I got the Red Ring of
Death](/archive/2007/04/10/xbox-360-red-ring-of-death.aspx) and [got to
go through the DRM hassle
again](/archive/2007/04/27/xbox-live-marketplace-still-has-drm-troubles.aspx). 
I don't want to discourage anyone from an Xbox 360 because *I truly love
mine* - I wouldn't put up with this garbage otherwise.  But this does
seem pretty ridiculous.

Here are some things Microsoft could do to make it up to me:

-   **Send me a second console free.**  I think there should be some
    sort of lemon law or something where if you get to the fourth
    console you get a second console free to use as a "backup" for the
    next time you have trouble.
-   **Send me two repair boxes.**  One to send my console in now, and
    one with a pre-authorized RMA number so I can skip the hassle of
    calling support and just send the next console in when it goes tits
    up.
-   **Give me a medal.**  Sort of like a [Purple
    Heart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart), but for severe
    Xbox trauma.  Something that says, "We know you've put up with a
    lot, and we want to recognize you as one of the die-hards."
-   **Free Xbox Live Gold for life.**  And maybe a couple of games, just
    for being a good sport.

I'm also thinking that there should be some sort of gamerscore
achievement.

Unlocked!](https://hyqi8g.dm1.livefilestore.com/y2pj_prSo5VXYVqDeJl3gnS3NWANh5S6kSgF2EWCdEvJlVL_fnoBLRU3t8WJJhlBgitnaQr7C8XKY0mn3gYjZ-k71yUdsp5SFYCvUH35Iy9Ggs/20070921achievement.gif?psid=1)

There's [a forum on the Xbox site about this
update](http://forums.xbox.com/15627101/ShowPost.aspx).  I guess I'm not
the only one who got hosed by this update, but I'm sure that happens
with every update.  I've heard about previous updates where people got
hosed but I was just fine.  YMMV, I guess.
