After a long, long, LONG week, Jenn and I have finally finished redoing
the living room, at least as best we can without buying all new
furniture. The room seems so much bigger since we moved things around,
and it has a lot more personality with the paint. Moving the TV and
stereo equipment paid off in that it's a lot cleaner looking (and the
cord management behind it is way better) but it was a huge pain in the
ass.

 Today is having trouble getting started for me. I woke up and totally
just *drug ass* out of bed. Normally I wake up in the shower; today I
nearly fell asleep. I'm still pretty tired. I went out to get my monthly
Cup Of Coffee from the air pots outside my cube... and they were empty.
That's pretty much a microcosm for my day thus far.

 On the other hand, the project I'm working on at work is coming along
splendidly (it's a content replication service for [Microsoft SharePoint
Portal Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/portalserver.asp), if
you care), especially since I just got in touch with developer support
over there to answer some questions that don't get answered in the
all-too-meager [SDK
documentation](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/downloads/tools/SDK.asp).

 I have to go to [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/) today to get a
couple of new frames for pictures that go in our new living room. The
frames we have, well, suck. So new frames will fix the fact that the
old, sucky frames don't go well in the "[Children Of The
Revolution](http://www.clubmoulinrouge.com)" French theme we have
going.

 While I'm there, I may listen to the new self-titled [Dirty
Vegas](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066HP6/mhsvortex)
album. [CDNow](http://www.cdnow.com/) (who sucks; don't *ever* buy
anything from them) said it would have "[appeal [to] the musically
unadventurous](<http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=650139712/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/album.html/itemid=1551275/select=review/pubid=7/docid=521830>),"
which is probably me, but then, I never seem to like the stuff they say
is all *revolutionary* and shit.

 Speaking of "revolutionary" music I don't dig, I watched the
[MTV](http://www.mtv.com/) Movie Awards last night and saw [The White
Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com/) perform. I'll be damned if I
could understand a *single word* from the song they played. It had sort
of a British punk feel to it, at least I thought so, and I could see
that if they cleaned it up *just a tad* I might be into it given the
right mood. The simple, retro-ish style they had sort of appealed to me.
I dunno.

 On the other hand, I thought that Kelly Osbourne's musical debut
singing "Papa Don't Preach" was pretty decent. She has an okay voice,
but no real stage presence to speak of. I think if she worked at it a
bit more, she could go somewhere. That'll be on the *[Osbourne Family
Album](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000067O2V/mhsvortex)*,
coming out June 11. Yes, I'll probably end up getting that.
