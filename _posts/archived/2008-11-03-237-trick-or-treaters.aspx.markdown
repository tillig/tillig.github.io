We saw a huge increase in the trick-or-treat count this year compared to
the previous [years](/archive/2005/11/01/155-trick-or-treaters.aspx)

![Trick-or-Treaters by Year: 237 kids in year
2008.](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pTWBaB1yp3urv7v7DIs454qy6H3iXVZ7c-iPbaalN_4M_bdcnrPapzqlv0u5Dt5EcWD3z0iqflRVevKuYXGlPuc-MP3osbc4cj8lirJADxbU/20081103trickortreatersud9.gif?psid=1)

Usually in the 7:00 - 7:30 pm time block we see a decrease in
trick-or-treaters showing up; this year we saw a huge increase. We again
ran from about 6:00p to 8:30p and that seemed to encompass the majority
of visitors. There may have been some folks we missed pre-6:00p, but we
had quite a lull after about 8:20p so shut it down at 8:30p.

-   Lots more little kids this year compared to last year, where we saw
    average age increase.
-   Halloween was on a Friday this year and I think that contributed to
    the increase in visitors. More parents willing to take their kids
    out for longer if they don't have to get up early the next day.
-   We got the animated Halloween projector running and showing a "Happy
    Halloween" message on the garage, which I think contributed to the
    number of visitors. A more festive atmosphere increases interest.
-   This is the second year for the new daylight saving time change due
    to the energy bill that passed, but I don't think it affected the
    trick-or-treat count.

Around the 7:00p time we ran dreadfully low on candy. With about 15
pieces left, Jenn hopped in the car and headed to the store, at which
point a tidal wave of kids showed up and drained me of the last of the
candy. I raided the cupboards and subsequent visitors drained me of all
of my Indiana Jones fruit snacks andÂ small packets of Swedish Fish that
I nabbed from the candy jar at work. By the time Jenn got back (only 15
minutes later) I was into handing out my stash of chewy ginger candy,
which is pretty spicy stuff that I'm sure caused some surprised faces on
a few youngsters. (Sorry, kids, it's all I had!)

I had a few favorite costumes that came by, but the three most
memorable:

-   A kid of unknown age had a huge homemade fabric garbage can costume.
    A great costume by any count, but I had to ask where to put the
    candy since there were no arms, bags, or other receptacles. The
    garbage can rotated 90 degrees and a little flap opened with a hand
    poking out - "Put it in my hand."
-   A middle-school aged kid was a Lego brick made of cardboard and
    paper. Really accurate - six Lego studs hanging out of the front,
    the whole thing to scale... but no arm holes, so his dad was
    carrying his candy bag.
-   A high school kid with a banana costume, a backpack, and a plastic
    knife. Normally I don't like handing candy out to older kids, but
    when a banana shows up and yells, "I'm a banana! Put the candy in
    the bag!" I was dying laughing. You win - here's your candy.

A banner year for trick-or-treaters this year. Next year I'm considering
doing more than just the projector on the garage. I think Halloween
falls on a Saturday next year, so I anticipate even more
trick-or-treaters.
