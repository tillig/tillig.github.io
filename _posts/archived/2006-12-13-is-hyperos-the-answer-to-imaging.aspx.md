I [wrote a couple of days
ago](/archive/2006/12/11/re-imaged-machine.aspx) about having to
re-image my work machine. Got an interesting email from a fellow named
David Groves about an application that may be the answer to my issues:
[HyperOS](http://www.hyperossystems.co.uk/). Looks like it's sort of a
cross between ghosting and multi-OS booting where you can have several
copies/versions of Windows running on one machine and easily back
up/switch between them.

 I've considered running my development environment in a virtual machine
but I've never wanted to incur that overhead. Even with all the
optimizations in the world, with the hardware I'm using the overhead of
a VM makes it noticeably slower than running natively and I need *more*
speed, not *less*. This HyperOS application looks like it gives you the
best of all worlds. Maybe I should try it out.
