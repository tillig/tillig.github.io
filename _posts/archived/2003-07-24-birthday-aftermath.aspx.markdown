Being 27, I've found, is not terribly different from being 26.
 
 Before we wax too philosophic, let's review the acknowledgements for
the day yesterday. I got email greetings from:

-   Douglas, a friend of mine in Texas
-   Gerb, a friend I've had since high school
-   Jenni, my cousin
-   Tanya, regular blog reader (via comments)
-   Kristin, a friend I haven't heard from for a loooong time
-   An automated mail system from a forum I'm a member of

Personal acknowledgements from about half of my department (there are
nine people in my department) came in about half an hour before I left,
when one of the guys was peeking over my shoulder and saw my calendar
with my birthday clearly marked.
 
 That's about it.
 
 I wasn't, like, expecting a party, but I guess I feel a little gypped
since everyone else's birthday around here gets remembered.
 
 So, anyway, that was the day. That evening, my mom, dad, sister Tai and
husband Dan, and grandfather (on Mom's side) came over and we had a
little cheesecake. Gifts were the following:

-   Stevie Wonder: *The Definitive Collection* (from Jenn)
-   *A Bug's Life* two-disc collector's edition DVD (from Jenn)
-   *La Femme Nikita* DVD (from Jenn)
-   A 7.0 amp Shop Vac (from Jenn)
-   A 12-pack of Shasta Tiki Punch (from Mom's cat)
-   *Xena: Warrior Princess* Season One DVD set (from Mom and Dad)
-   A gift certificate to Michael's (from Tai and Dan)

I liked all the stuff I got, and it was good to see everyone over. My
grandparents on my dad's side and my sister Tori in Utah were sort of
MIA as far as birthday greetings, though, which I think is kinda
crappy.
 
 But oh well. It's not like I expected anything in particular, but I'm
feeling a little disappointed nonetheless. I guess that's just how
things go the longer time goes by.
