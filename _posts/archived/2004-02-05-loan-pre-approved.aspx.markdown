Ann, my mortgage broker, just called and I've not only had my home loan
approved (well, pre-approved; I don't have the money, I just know it's
there if I need it) but I've got *excellent* credit to boot. She's
sending all of that info to me in the mail, and she's told me that she
put a smiley face next to my credit rating to indicate how awesome it
is.
 
 Looks like it's time to focus on finding that house. We've got a couple
of walkthroughs on Saturday scheduled, and hopefully by then we'll have
something new to look at, too.
