I've been pretty addicted to this [Seattle radio station,
C89.5](http://www.c895fm.com), since [my trip to
Bellevue](/archive/2003/04/22/slave-to-the-dark-beat.aspx). Thank
goodness they broadcast online.

 I hate normal radio for several reasons:

- Too many commercials. For every minute of music, there are like two
    minutes of commercials. This is worse during most morning shows,
    where there are three minutes of commercials for every minute of
    comedic drivel.
- Radio "powers." Songs that are considered "power" on the radio get
    repeated over... and over... and over... Most of the time I hate
    those songs. Who says payola doesn't exist anymore?
- I'm WHITE. Let's be frank - most of the new stuff coming out is
    Ebonic-laden hip-hop. Admittedly, I can dig some of it, but not as
    much as is getting cranked out. Pronounce your words, people. And
    make it something I can hum along to. You can't hum to hip-hop.

 C89.5 overcomes all of these obstacles. It doesn't play commercials
because it's a public radio station, run by a Seattle high school. It
does repeat songs, but they're songs I can get into and enjoy. I
understand all of the words to all of the songs. And I can hum or
whistle along. Added bonus - all the tunes are *danceable*.

 So I'm digging it.

 Anyway, they're having a [pledge drive](https://nrgmusic.com/c89/)
because apparently the school has pretty much cut their funding and they
have to raise their own. From what I'm gathering, they've had to do this
in past years, but this year's a little tighter because they've gone
online and the funding has been cut (as is standard with school funding
nowadays).

 I started thinking about school funding. From what I can tell, they cut
the drama departments and the libraries before they cut sports. That's
cool if you're into the sports *thing*, but I'm not. I'm the guy the
jocks picked on. I'm the guy who went to the library. I'm the guy who
loved the drama department.

 I'm pretty sure the kids in the radio broadcasting program want to be
there. I wish *my* high school had run a radio program. I'd have been
there. And I know that I'd be pretty pissed off to see that the assholes
playing football still got to run around on the field where they're
learning no marketable skills while I'm trying to learn something and my
program gets shit-canned.

 So I went to the [pledge site](https://nrgmusic.com/c89/) (which I
encourage *you* to do, as well), checked out the different things you
get for different pledge levels, and really wanted the custom dance mix
CD... but didn't want to pledge the $89.50 for it. I like the station,
but I'm not going to single-handedly support the place.

 Instead, I threw in $50 to get the t-shirt. You can get a "can-cozy"
for $35, but... I don't need a can-cozy. I'll wear the shirt with
pride, though. So a shirt it is.

 I'm sure I'll hear about this when I get home. We really are pretty
strapped for cash lately, what with Jenn working pro-bono at her
pharmacy technician externship. I figure it as an investment in
something I believe in, though, and it's tax-deductible, which is a Good
Thing. (Of course, I don't own a house or anything, so my contributions
rarely actually make any difference on my overall deduction at the end
of the year.)

 Anyway, [listen to the music](http://www.c895fm.com/), love the
station, then [go pledge](https://nrgmusic.com/c89/). It's worth it.
