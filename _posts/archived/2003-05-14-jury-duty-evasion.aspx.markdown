I just got the call that I've successfully been excused from Federal
jury duty on July 9. My reasons? Well, first, I'm signed up for loads of
training through work that really can't be adjusted; second, I'm going
to have a difficult time paying the rent and eating if I'm not getting a
paycheck.

 Long story short, I can't do it. So I got the call, and I don't have to
report.

 Some things *do* go right.
