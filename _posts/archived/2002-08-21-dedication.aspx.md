I was going to write about this one yesterday but forgot. I remembered
yesterday evening on the way home.

 It rained yesterday. The weather report had called for rain ("chance of
showers" usually indicates "it's gonna pour") for a week.

 On the way to work, I saw this guy driving a convertible [Mazda
Miata](http://www.mazdausa.com/miata/default.asp?vehicle=miata) with the
top down. It was *totally raining*, as the weather report said it would.
That got me thinking. Either that guy was a *frickin' moron* and decided
to ignore the fact that the sky was all clouding that morning, or he was
*utterly dedicated* to having his top down that day, come hell or high
water.

 I vote "moron."

 Another thing I thought about last night on the way home: hip-hop
music.

 I *hate* hip-hop. There's something about the way they can't decide on
a tempo or the way everything is so utterly *ebonic* that just turns me
off.

 **However**, I like hip-hop that features clarinets. Like Blu
Cantrell's [*Hit 'Em Up
Style*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005LN65/mhsvortex) and
Dani Stevenson's [*Yo, Yo,
Yo*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BTB6/mhsvortex). I'm
not sure why I figure those songs are better, they just seem to be more
catchy or something. Almost like there's some implicit amount of class
in the song if they can squeeze a clarinet into the mix. Maybe I just
like clarinets.

 [*American Idol*](http://idolonfox.msn.com) last night rocked. I've
been waiting for them to get a little more contemporary with the tunes,
and they finally did.
[Nikki](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/nicky_ozmet/default.asp)
also finally found her niche, which is good, because based on last
week's performance I'd have voted her off. Now I'm thinking
[Justin](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/justin_guarini/default.asp)
needs to go. The best is still
[Kelly](http://idolonfox.msn.com/contestants/ind/kelly_clarkson/default.asp).
