Jack Black can't write.

 I borrowed a couple of episodes of [Tenacious
D](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000E2FLB/mhsvortex) from a
friend of mine to watch. He was telling me that it was hysterical. I was
excited to check them out.

 Hoo boy.

 See, I love [Jack Black](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085312/). I think
he's hilarious in stuff I've seen him in. But this just wasn't funny,
and I can chalk it up to one of two things: Either he's one of those
people who is either "hot or not" (and I got two "not" episodes) or Jack
Black can't write.

 The key here is that when I've seen him being funny, it's him acting
out someone else's writing. The Tenacious D stuff is his. And it's not
funny. Or maybe I just "don't get it." There were a couple of funny
parts, but by and large... well, let's say I'm not going to run out and
rent the DVDs any time soon.
