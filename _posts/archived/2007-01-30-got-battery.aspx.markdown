Went to lunch at [Sonic](http://www.sonicdrivein.com/) with
[Scoble](http://itmanager.blogs.com/) today. Unfortunately, wasn't able
to leave Sonic because my battery - fresh from being jumpstarted - was
dead. Again.

 A quick trip to [Les Schwab](http://www.lesschwab.com/) fixed me up,
but that was $50 worth of battery I really wasn't prepared to spend
over lunch. And it doesn't enhance [my
mood](/archive/2007/01/30/little-annoying-things.aspx) any. Could've
been worse, I suppose. Might have been a starter or alternator or
something. Then again, the day ain't over yet.
