I called [iRobot customer
support](http://www.irobot.com/sp.cfm?pageid=102) today regarding the
charger issue I've had for the last couple of days. [I've had to contact
iRobot customer support
before](/archive/2005/06/21/karmic-blowback.aspx) when my Roomba was
doing some weird things and they sent me a whole new Roomba, no problem.
This time they're sending me a whole new charger and home base for the
Roomba. The guy I spoke with, Chris, was totally nice and easy going,
not condescending or annoying like many support folks you talk to. The
fact that they're just sending me a replacement unit speaks volumes,
too. (Besides the fact that it sort of tells you how much profit margin
must be built into these things, it also tells you that they really want
their products to succeed and be used.)

 Right on, iRobot. Thanks for doing support *right*.

 One thing: If you're going to contact them, contact them via phone.
They can't solve much via email and most times they just tell you to
call them. Just so you know.

 Of course, now my cordless drill battery charger is dead. I'm just
having bad luck with battery chargers lately, I guess. It'd cost me $30
to replace the charger, but that's how much the drill cost me, and since
I can get a new, better drill (with two batteries included!) for $70, I
guess I'll be donating this one and getting me a new one.
