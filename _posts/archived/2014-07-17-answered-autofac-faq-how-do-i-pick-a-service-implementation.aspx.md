Over at Autofac we're trying to get [a more robust set of documentation
out](http://autofac.readthedocs.io/) to help folks. The wiki is nice,
but it leaves a lot to be desired.

As part of that, we're also trying to get some answers published to some
of the more frequently asked questions we see popping up on
StackOverflow.

[Today I pushed out the doc answering that timeless question, "How do I
pick a service implementation based on a particular context or consuming
object?"](http://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/select-by-context.html)
