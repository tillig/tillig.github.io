Some people might say that when you start to feel a little lightheaded
and hyped from your caffeine intake that you've probably had quite
enough. I think that's more of an indicator that you're almost *in the
zone*. More is better.

 We get free carbonated beverages here at work. There are fountains on
every floor, and they alternate Pepsi/Coke/Pepsi so you can get whatever
you want, pretty much. I'm a Pepsi product drinker, but I sit on a Coke
floor. Not great, but I can't really complain.

 I went down one floor just now to refill my Mountain Dew IV and they're
*out of carbonated water* down there, so it's all *syrup*. Ugh.

 Went up two floors to the next Pepsi dispenser and *they're out of
syrup*, so it's all *carbonated water*. Someone needs to get these
floors together so I can get a damn drink.

 Argh! I ended up with Dr. Pepper and called it good. Why does the world
hate me?
