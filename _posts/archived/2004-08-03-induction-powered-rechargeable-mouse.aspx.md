I have a wireless mouse at work that eats two AA batteries a month, give
or take. They make rechargeable mice, but it seems like everything has a
cradle or charger or something attached to it all the time, and this is
no different.
 
 Okay, so here's your million-dollar idea for the day: *Use induction to
charge your mouse.*
 
 Now, I'm the first to admit that I'm no electrical engineer, and I'm
probably talking through my ass right now, but I remember my physics 101
- if you run a magnet along a wire, you get electrical current. Well,
you're constantly moving your mouse around, right? What if you could
apply some sort of power source to the mouse pad to speed things up a
little and recharge your wireless mouse through induction? You need a
mouse pad anyway, so there's no separate special charger or anything;
just plug in the mouse pad and use the mouse - no need to recharge.
 
 When you become a billionaire off that one, kick a million my way.
