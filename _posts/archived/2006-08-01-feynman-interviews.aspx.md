Richard Feynman was, by any measure, The Man. Full stop. [This video of
several interviews with him just proves
it.](http://www.thescian.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1172-But,-you-gotta-stop-and-think.html)
No one can entertain and educate quite the way he did. [If you haven't
read the book, get
it.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393316041/mhsvortex)
