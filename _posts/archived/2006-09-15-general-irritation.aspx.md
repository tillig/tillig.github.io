I'm generally irritated today and I don't think it's any one particular
thing, so I can't say what the root of it is, but I'll gladly share some
of the stuff pissing me off. Granted, more of a cathartic effort for me
than a great entry for the readers.

 There's one week left for RSVPs to come back for the wedding and we've
only gotten about half back. Yeah, folks have a week left, but I think
it's time to start chasing people down. There's really no margin for
folks to just be showing up without having replied. Which means I'm
going to have to start getting email reminders out to folks with email
and call the rest personally. I'm not sure what the difficulty is with
sending a pre-addressed, pre-stamped postcard, but apparently it's a
showstopper for some folks.

 I'm concerned that a good friend of mine is becoming a workaholic,
possibly entirely out of boredom, as they have become fairly distant in
recent times. Not to mention pretty conservative with information about
what they've been up to. I'm not interested in the gory details of
peoples' lives, but when you get together to talk to someone and it's a
one-way information sharing street unless you ask just the right
questions, it becomes a little stilted.

 On that same note, I got an instant message from another friend who
seems to know a hell of a lot more about what I'm doing than I know
about what they're doing. It's been a while since I've gotten together
with this friend, but somehow they are entirely up to speed on a lot of
things - things I've not posted, emailed, IM'd or talked to them about.
That's a little disconcerting, and I'm not sure how I really feel about
it. I'm glad to reconnect with this friend, but I think if my friend
wants to know what's up with me and Jenn... they should ask me and
Jenn.

 I'm super bored with the latest project at work which involves a hell
of a lot of "review this stuff you've already done." And I'm tired of
people telling me when I mention how boring it is that, "you have to
take the good with the bad" or "business needs require tasks that aren't
as fun sometimes" or whatever. *I get it.* I mean, I'm doing what needs
to be done, right? That doesn't make it fun, it only justifies the
requirement. I'm not debating the requirement. I'm debating my
motivational difficulties in completing the task.

 Anyway, it'll get done, I just have this vehement ennui.

 Hey, that's a good band name. "Vehement Ennui."

 Okay, done ranting. Time to get to work.
