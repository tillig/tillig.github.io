Saturday was my 12th treatment on my face, and the last in my second set
of six (they sell treatments in blocks of six).

A lot has changed since the first treatment, so since I re-upped for a
third set of six, I thought it would be time for a retrospective.

-   It still hurts, but it's *nothing* like [the first time I
    went](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx). I
    get [MeDioStar](http://www.medsurgeadvances.com/mediostar_xt.php) on
    my entire face now, and it's not nearly as bad because the hair is
    so much thinner. Reading back on that first entry, I totally
    remember how much apprehension I felt before going back for the
    second treatment. I don't feel that anymore. (There really is no way
    you can prepare someone for it, so I think a lot of my reaction was
    that my pain-related expectations were vastly different than
    reality. Whattaya gonna do?)
-   I still really like all of the people at the clinic. Everyone from
    the folks at the front desk to the technicians and the sales people
    are super nice. They all remember my name, they all make me feel
    totally welcome, and they're super easy to get along with. I'm glad
    I chose them.
-   I thought I'd be a closer to done than I am, but then, I was
    supposed to have done 12 MeDioStar treatments by now and I haven't.
    I spent a lot of time doing just [Dermo
    Flash](http://sanadome.nl/sanadomeEN/health/dermoflash.html) to thin
    things out. It was the right thing to do, but it's taking a while.
-   I really like the results so far. My hair grows differently on my
    face - I pretty much have to shave against the grain to get a good
    shave - but I've also not destroyed any sheets, pillowcases, or
    shirts for quite some time.
-   The spots that are being stubborn are my chin, upper lip, a spot on
    my right cheek, and a spot on my neck. The rest has done really
    well. Even the stubborn spots are starting to give way, it's just
    taking a while.

So I did my thing, got my second set of six, and I'm crusin' along. I
should probably take some before and after pix in a couple of weeks to
see how well this next set of treatments goes.
