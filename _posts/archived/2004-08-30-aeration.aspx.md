Most of the weekend was spent doing yardwork; at least, the majority of
Saturday was. I bought this lawn aerator device that is basically a set
of spikes attached to a handle - step on the spikes to push them into
the ground, pull the handle to get them out of the ground. Like
dangerous [romper
stompers](http://www.robynsnest.com/homemade.htm#Romper).

 Thing is, that trashes your back really quickly, so the rest of the
weekend I ached. I still ache.

 We also started painting the upstairs bathroom, which is already
proving to be less painful than the last bathroom we painted because: a)
we're only painting two of the walls; and b) there's no [border that has
to be sanded off](/archive/2004/07/02/wall-decals.aspx). We got a coat
of primer on there pretty quickly. We'll put another coat of primer,
then two coats of paint, then be done.

 And, of course, there was the typical cleaning of... well,
*everything*... as there usually is.

 Oh! I got my [*L'Instant Taittinger*
poster](http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp?item=421309&AID=273632&PSTID=1&LTID=1)
back, framed, from Michael's and it looks *brilliant*. That's now in my
entryway so you see it pretty much right when you walk in.
