More a reminder for me than anything... last week I was having a hell of
a time getting my Pocket PC to sync up. I'm not sure what happened - one
second it was working, then it disconnected and wouldn't reconnect
again. Rebooted and no luck. I ended up figuring that something weird
happened to the drivers (it kept registering as an "unknown device").

 But where do you get the USB drivers for Pocket PC?

 [This is what I ended up
using](http://www.driverzone.com/device.php?id=2391&show_devs=a) and it
seems to support a load of models (including my ViewSonic V37). Now I'm
back in business.
