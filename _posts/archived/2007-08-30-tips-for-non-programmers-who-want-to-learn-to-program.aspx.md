![Shout at the

have a pretty diverse group of friends, some of whom are developers and
some of whom aren't.  A subset of the non-developer folks have, at
times, mentioned to me that they really want to learn how to program
but:

-   They don't have a computer background.
-   They fear it takes a long time to learn how to do anything good.
-   They don't have time to go to school.
-   They don't want to read thousands of pages worth of books before
    writing code.
-   They're intimidated by the seeming complexity of programming.

There are plenty of people out there who are self-taught programmers. 
For non-developers who want to learn, don't be discouraged.  Here are my
recommendations for people in this situation:

-   **Start small.**  Don't try to build a 3D rendering engine as your
    first program.  Don't try to build an RSS reader as your first
    program.  Don't try to build a screen saver as your first program. 
    Instead, pick a small task that you do all the time and automate
    that.  Maybe once a week you copy last week's status report
    and rename it to something new so you can start this week's status
    report.  Maybe you manually read through a text file and summarize a
    report out of it every day.  Pick something small and repetitive to
    automate as your first task.
-   **Avoid GUI programming.**  There are lots of great WYSIWYG tools
    out there for dragging buttons onto forms and having cool things
    happen, but these tools mask a lot of the goings-on from the
    developer and that's not always a good thing.  If things work
    perfectly, no problem.  If they don't... well, it can be a
    frustrating experience for the newbie.  Write something that runs at
    a command line so you won't have to deal with the windowing
    environment.
-   **Keep focused on your task.**  Your first program that prints
    something to the screen is referred to as a "Hello World" program
    (because, classically, the first line it prints is "Hello World"). 
    Do your "Hello World" and then get back to the task you chose to
    do.  Why?  Having a task to accomplish is a milestone.  If you're
    just tinkering around in "Hello World" land, it's hard to really see
    any results or feel fulfilled that you're learning anything.  That's
    discouraging and I've seen several folks just give up because they
    didn't feel like they were getting anywhere.
-   **Use a scripting language.**  You probably shouldn't try your first
    program in C++ when there are so many far easier languages to use to
    accomplish simple tasks.  I'd look at
    [VBScript](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sx7b3k7y.aspx),
    [batch
    scripting](http://labmice.techtarget.com/scripting/batchfiles.htm),
    [AppleScript](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/), or
    some other simple, high-level scripting language of your choice. 
    (HTML is *not*a programming language, so don't pick that.)
-   **Take online tutorials and *do the exercises*.**  There are several
    free online resources to learn how to do simple scripting.  Take
    advantage of them.  When you see code examples or exercises in these
    tutorials, do them.  There's nothing quite like actually doing it to
    help you understand.
-   **Get a tutorial book *and* a reference book.**  Once you've picked
    a language (most likely after you've done one or two of the online
    tutorials) go to your local bookstore and pick up a tutorial book
    and a reference book on your chosen language.  The tutorial book
    will teach you how to do simple things in your language and will
    have a title like "Learn BlahBlah In A Week."  Tutorial books are
    good to augment the online tutorials you find out there.  The
    reference book will help you as you're working so if you need to
    look up what all of the options are for a certain thing, it's right
    there.  When you're starting out, a book might easier to deal with
    than trying to coordinate online help and your script across
    multiple windows/monitors.
-   **Don't get overwhelmed and don't give up.**  Programming isn't
    slam-dunk easy.  If it was, there'd be a lot of programmers out of
    jobs.  Don't let yourself get overwhelmed by your efforts.  If you
    find that it's becoming so overwhelming that it's not fun anymore
    and you don't feel like you're making any progress, maybe you picked
    a task that was too difficult.  Instead of giving up, pick a smaller
    task or maybe break the task you're trying to automate down into
    smaller sub-tasks and solve each one independently.  For example, if
    you're copying and renaming a file and that's too hard, maybe just
    do the copy part first and handle the renaming after you get the
    first part down.

For the developers out there, what do you tell people who ask you how to
start learning to program?
