[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 32]

 I entered a contest over at [Penny
Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com/) the other day to win an
[XBox](http://www.xbox.com) game. Of course, I'm a loser, so I didn't
win, but what else is new?

 They did link to me in their [news section
today](http://www.penny-arcade.com/news2002-04-12.html), which is cool;
maybe I'll get some traffic now, since I think the only people reading
this are, like, Jenn and my mom. I've got a bit of mixed emotion going
on about *where* they linked to in my site, though: my [Gen<sup>13</sup> links
page](/gen13/genlinks.html).

 The reason I'm mixed is that I'm really not maintaining the Gen<sup>13</sup>
stuff around here anymore, and I'd hate for folks to come in and go,
"Oh, look - another *stale links page*. I'm outta here!" without coming
into the blog section here and checking things out.

 I'm not looking the gift horse in the mouth, though. They wanna link to
me? I'm down with that. One of these days when I have some money, I'm
going to have to [send them
some](http://www.penny-arcade.com/clubpa.php3). I *can* say I am the
proud owner of [their
book](http://www.kiwepublishing.com/bookstore/pennybooks.html), as
should you be.

 I noticed that all the songs on the GTA3 soundtrack from the
"Flashback" radio station are from the [soundtrack to
*Scarface*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000024613/mhsvortex).
I may have to pick that up for the novelty factor.
