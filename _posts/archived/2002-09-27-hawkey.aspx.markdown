*And now, for the first time in the 2002-2003 season, Portland...*

 ***LET'S...***

 ***PLAY...***

 ***HAWKEY!***

 Tonight is the season opener game for [Portland Winter
Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) hockey, and I am *stoked*. I've got
my jersey on, I've got the hockey music playing... I'm ready to drive
the [Zamboni](http://www.zamboni.com).

 It's been a long time coming, and I'm glad to see it here. I just hope
that I don't feel as busy as I did last season - it seemed like I spent
most of my waking hours at the Memorial Coliseum watching hockey and
not, you know, doing anything *productive*.

 Whatever. It's hockey night, and I'm down with that. I hear this new
guy we've got, CJ Jackson, is quite the bruiser. 6'3", 242 lbs... Hey,
if he can *fuck shit up* like Eric Bowen did, I'm going to be having a
*rockin'* season. Fast skatin', chuckin' pucks, and blood on the ice.
That's what it's *all about*.

 On a side note, I found out what the [two $600
charges](/archive/2002/09/26/attilla.aspx) were for on my medical
insurance: The 10 bottles of allergy antigen that got mixed up for my
allergy immunization shots. They mix all the bottles up at once and bill
you in one chunk rather than mixing the stuff up as you need it. I feel
much better now - I couldn't figure out what I did that day that cost me
$1200 at the doctor. Now I know.
