Last night, due to the graces of On Demand video, Jenn and I watched
[*The Master of
Disguise*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007JMEB/mhsvortex).

 Hoooo boy.

 How do movies like this get made? I mean, who reads a script like that
and says, "Hey, this will be great on film! Let's do it!" I understand
that there's a market for children's films, but even kids are going to
wonder what the makers of this pile of shit were smoking.

 I think I laughed like four times. Mostly it was at the quips the
grandfather character used to tell [Dana
Carvey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001022/) to shut up. Stuff like
"curb your yammering skullcave," which I will now attempt to work into
daily conversation somehow. It cracked me up because it was so out of
nowhere... but those were about the only things that were any good. (Do
you remember when Dana Carvey was actually funny? I do. I miss those
days.)

 That's an hour and a half of my life I will never reclaim. ([And I'm
not the only one who thinks
so.](http://www.tylerpaper.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=4947762&BRD=1994&PAG=461&dept_id=517472&rfi=6))
I am actually *dumber* for having watched that. [I award myself no
points, and may God have mercy on my
soul](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0783229445/mhsvortex).
