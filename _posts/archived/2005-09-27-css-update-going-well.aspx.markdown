I think the update is going pretty well. As I grab a moment here and
there, I'm able to complete more and more stuff. There's still oddness,
like the fact the site looks fine in Firefox but there's this weirdness
in IE where the main page sort of slants off to the left with each new
entry... and bulleted lists in entries are different in IE than
Firefox... but it's not impossible to overcome. I'll keep working on it,
but I'm pretty pleased with what it's shaping up into - Visual
Paraesthesia .NET! Heh.
