My [Sharp Aquos
LC-37D7U](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007UVYLW/mhsvortex)
showed up today at 11:00a and it looks *spectacular*. The delivery guy
thinks he was the one who originally delivered my 40" Sony CRT. That'd
be funny.
 
 The first movie I'm going to watch is [*The Fifth
Element*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006GVJE4/mhsvortex),
my favorite. It's got some great detail to it, too, so it'll be a nice
test of the new set's capabilities. Totally looking forward to it.
 
 And thus ends an era, the era of Distort-o-Vision, the 40" CRT that
stuck with me for two years.
 
 Rest in peace, Distort-o-Vision. October 2002 - February 2005.
