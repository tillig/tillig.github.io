It's been a long week. All week long, I've awakened being thoroughly
convinced it's Tuesday. Even Monday, I could've sworn it was Tuesday.

 We got our first *official* build out today, though, so I'm pretty
stoked for that. It sort of legitimizes what we've been working on for
the past few months.

 I've also been working on
[CR_Documentor](/archive/2004/11/15/cr_documentor-the-documentor-plug-in-for-dxcore.aspx)
some, adding some fun new features to help folks edit their XML comments
(like inserting documentation templates and embedding selected text in
XML comment structures). That's coming along nicely and should be out
shortly.

 Got a [hockey game](http://www.winterhawks.com) tonight. Not a lot of
excitement there, but hopefully I'll be amped up a little more by the
time we get there.

 I'm also still doing my best not to focus on the fact that [my TV is
still hosed](/archive/2005/02/07/busy-tv-repairmen.aspx). It's
distracting, but I'm doing okay there.

 Jenn works tomorrow, so I'll be home alone. Maybe I'll have to play a
little Playstation or GameCube. It's been a while.
