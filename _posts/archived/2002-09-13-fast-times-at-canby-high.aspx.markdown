Tonight's Jenn's 10-year high school reunion, and I'm not going to lie
to you and tell you I'm stoked to go. I'm not. I didn't like *my* high
school experience, so I'm not expecting to love hanging out and
discussing *other peoples'* experiences.
 
 There is a redeeming factor, however.
 
 See, Jenn's got this high school friend, Apryl. Apryl's cool and all,
but she's not the point here. (Not to belittle Apryl or anything; love
her to death and all, but that's not where I'm going here.) The point
is, Apryl married this guy, Tony, who is a *total kick in the pants*.
We've hung out with them and I just have the greatest time talking with
this guy. I think we just work on the same wavelength or something. He's
just really cool and fun.
 
 So I'm doing my best to look at this less as "Jenn's High School
Reunion" and more "Trav and Tony Hang-Out Time." Maybe we can ditch and
go home and play PS2. Heh.
 
 I found a cool volunteer job that I totally would dig on over at
[YouBored.com](http://www.youbored.com) - they are currently [in need of
a movie reviewer](http://www.youbored.com/moviereviewer.shtml). I think
I could fill those shoes, no problem. Hey, you've seen the work right
here on this site. No problemo for the old Trav, if you know what I
mean. And maybe I could get a little extra traffic in here, too. The
only issue is that they want one person to do ALL the movies, and I
don't have time to do that. So I'll drop 'em a line and see if they
might want a person on the side. Maybe they can split the job into two
pieces. Can't hurt to ask.
