Solvent 1.1.1 is out with a minor bug fix allowing for "Command Prompt
Here" to open the command prompt to drives other than the one VS.NET is
installed. (Oops!)

 I've also (finally) put the Solvent source out there for folks curious
how it works. You'll see a lot of stubbed-in stuff where I was/am trying
to get the Windows "Send To" menu to show up in there, but it'll
probably just forever be stubbed since there's no great way to interface
with "Send To," particularly in a managed code world.

 Anyway, the update's out, so [go get
it](/archive/2004/06/25/solvent---power-toys-for-visual-studio-.net.aspx).
