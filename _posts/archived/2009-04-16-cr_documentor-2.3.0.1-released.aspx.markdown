With the release of DXCore 9.1.3 I've also [released a new version of
CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com). Some changes in
DXCore caused the previous versions of CR\_Documentor to fail, so if
you've upgraded your DXCore/CodeRush/Refactor install, you'll want the
new CR\_Documentor to go with it.
