Just got back from seeing [*Spider-Man
2*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316654/).
 
 *Loved it.*
 
 Before I get too carried away, the one-sentence plot: Doctor Otto
Octavius ([Alfred Molina](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000547/)), a
brilliant physicist, goes mad in an attempt to create a self-sustaining
fusion reaction and Spider-Man has to stop him.
 
 Okay, so that's *really* distilled down, but I don't want to give too
much away. Just trust me - it was great.
 
 Really, I couldn't have asked for much more. We get the same great
rendering of the comic book on film that we saw in [the first
one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/), but so much more. We get
[another] great villain. We get the love story between Peter ([Tobey
Maguire](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001497/)) and Mary Jane ([Kirsten
Dunst](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000379/)). We get all the action we
paid our money to see, the [really cool] special effects we crave, and
we still get the attention to the characters that makes us actually
*care* what happens.
 
 The movie involves you enough that we had people in the theater
clapping and cheering for the heroic parts. At the end of the movie, you
just want more.
 
 And, of course, there [*will be
more*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/). They left it totally open
for the sequel, which I now can't wait for. It reminds me of when I saw
the first one and couldn't wait to see this. It's been worth the wait.
I'm going to have to go home and watch the first one again now.
 
 (Oh, and for the astute viewer, you'll notice all of the little [Sam
Raimi-isms](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000600/bio) you've come to know
and love in Sam's films. You just can't beat that.)
