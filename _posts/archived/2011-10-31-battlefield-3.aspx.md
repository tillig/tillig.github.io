I finally got a chance to crack open [*Battlefield
3*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003O6G5TW?tag=mhsvortex) this weekend. I
like it... to a point.

I've played through what I believe to be about half of the single-player
campaign. The graphics and sound are really well done and the gameplay
is reasonably engaging. I'm enjoying the story so far and the variety of
missions is enough to keep me interested.

There are two things about the single-player missions that detract from
my experience:

1. **The lights are too light and the darks are too dark.** When you're
    in a daytime mission, the environment is extremely light, in some
    cases to a point where it feels like you're missing details in
    things because it's all whiteout. The night/dark missions are really
    dark, sometimes even making you tweak your video settings to turn up
    the brightness... which then kills you when you get back to daytime.
    It isn't just me - my dad noticed the same thing in his setup. I've
    disabled all of the dynamic contrast and super-black settings and
    all that junk in my TV. The only thing I can think is that they are
    trying to simulate your eyes adjusting due to lights - you're in the
    dark, some lights hit you and BAM you can't see anything. However,
    it's really frustrating because you end up always missing something,
    making the game harder than it needs to be.
2. **It's sometimes hard to figure out what you're supposed to do.**
    Sometimes they give you visual cues of who you're supposed to follow
    or what buttons to push, sometimes they don't. I've run off and
    totally gotten lost because I think I'm going the right way when I'm
    not.

I've also tried the co-op missions. Well, I've tried two of them. I'd
have tried more, but my dad and I can't get past the second one.

The difficulty on the co-op missions is ridiculous. We played the first
mission on Easy and barely survived. The second mission involves flying
a helicopter and giving close air support to a ground team. We'd have
succeeded on that if the helicopter wasn't so damn hard to fly. I have
an R/C helicopter but it has coaxial blades and no collective to mess
with. Flying the helicopter in this game forces you to deal with full
collective - roll, pitch, and yaw - and it's far, far too easy to dump
it on its side. Anyway, it's hard enough to fly that we can't even beat
that one on Easy, which means we can't unlock any more co-op missions
(because you have to progress through them to unlock more).

Not that it makes much difference, since there appears to be only eight
total co-op missions.

I thought, honestly, there'd be more in the way of co-op. The whole
reason I got it was to play co-op with my dad since we thought there'd
be some level of co-op campaign. Oh, well.

I have not tried the multiplayer part of the game. Not because it isn't
good or whatever, but because I'm pretty much done with free-for-all,
plotless game types. "Team Deathmatch" has no point. There's no real
teamwork, it just means half the people aren't out to kill you. "Capture
the Flag" just goes back and forth and never gets anywhere. "Horde Mode"
sorts of things where it's just endless wave after wave of enemies isn't
interesting either. What's the point? I really like co-op campaign sorts
of things where there's both teamwork and a mission.

Anyway, like I said, *Battlefield 3* is decent... but I may sort of be
done with the war-based FPS until someone can bring back co-op campaign.
(Seriously waiting for *Borderlands 2*!)
