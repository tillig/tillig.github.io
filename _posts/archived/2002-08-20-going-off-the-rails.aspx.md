Jenn and I were talking last night about, well, *nothing* in particular,
and I took one of my random sidetracks as usual and she wondered why I
had said something I did and how my train of thought had reached it.
Stopping to think about it, I realize that I have very quick, very
divergent trains of thought when it comes to conversations, and most of
the time it has to do with a pop culture reference.

 For example, this morning in the car I was listening to Kylie Minogue's
[*Fever*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y228/mhsvortex)
album, to the song *Love at First Sight*, and I suddenly wondered what
ever happened to [Crazy Daisy
Ed](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?lastnode_id=379673&node_id=27419)...

 How did I get there? It went something like this:

- Heard lyrics to Kylie Minogue song: "I thought that I was going
    crazy / Just having one of those days, yeah..."
- I wonder why she used "days, yeah" to rhyme with "crazy." That
    doesn't really work. What rhymes with "crazy?" "Daisy" works...
- Crazy / Daisy...
- Hey, I wonder what happened to Crazy Daisy Ed?

 See how that works? That one was pretty simple. It's sort of like "[Six
Degrees of Kevin Bacon](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/)" - any
thought can be connected to any other thought. Just like that.

 I framed my *[Bi√®res de la
Meuse](http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?aid=273632&item=290944)*
print last night using a frame I had been trying to find a use for. The
frame was 18" x 25" and the print is 18" x 24", so I had to do a little
trimming. The frame is metal, but I have this keen little saw and mitre
box that worked just as well on metal as it does on wood. Yay, me! I
didn't quite make the cleanest cut on one of the frame pieces, so I had
to [Dremel](http://www.dremel.com/) it down... but I think I either used
[the wrong
bit](http://www.dremel.com/productdisplay/bit_template.asp?SKU=932&Color=009933)
or maybe just went a little too hard on it because now there's melted
metal all over the bit and I've gotta get a new one. Oh, well. It was
something to do that *wasn't* watching television, so I can't really
complain. Plus, the picture looks really good in the frame, so all's
well that ends well or something like that.
