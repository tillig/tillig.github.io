My ninth
[treatment](/archive/2008/02/11/laser-hair-removal-treatment-7.aspx)Â was
Saturday morning. They got a new laser at the facility and I think it's
more powerful than the previous one, because it hurt a little more and
when I was done I had little red welts all over my face that looked like
bad acne. I had this same sort of reaction the very first time I went in
for treatment and they tried the laser on me, so it's not like I'd never
seen it before and I definitely wasn't worried. That said, it was sort
of painful and the technician put some ointment on my face and told me
not to shave or otherwise irritate it for a day.

My chin is really the only really dark hair I have left on my face, and
that's patchy at best. The rest of my face has small hairless patches
among sparse hair patches where the hair is growing, but is much finer
and more manageable. My upper lip still has a decent amount of hair on
it, but the tech is really jumping in on that to make sure it's taken
care of.

I have three more treatments in this "package" (they sell treatments in
packs of six). I'm looking forward to where I'm at when I end this set.
Wondering if I'll need more or not. I don't know if I'll be totally
hairless, but it'll be considerably thinner. I've definitely enjoyed the
results so far - I haven't ruined any shirts, sheets, or pillowcases for
quite some time now (my beard used to just destroy these things).
