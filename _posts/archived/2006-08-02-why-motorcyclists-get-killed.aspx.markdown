We haven't done a Traffic Asshole in a while, so I figured it'd be a
good time.
 
 Jenn and I took a trip up to the [Empress
Palace](http://www.empresspalace.com) last week to do some wedding
preparations. Traffic was pretty heavy and Jenn was driving, so I hung
out with the camera on the lookout for traffic assholes (as is my
wont).
 
 It really didn't take long.
 
 Check this guy out:
 
 ![This is why motorcyclists get
killed.](https://hyqi8g.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y2pUKkUAUPwJFU8K4vzaGdxgnabSXz1sWY5JClrrtcoIWoIYlomDBvgzT6lTh0JMzc_sPomK9RwsIn8MRAFRGnEdfWV1l6K3esfJOtuwJw8i04/20060802taotw.jpg?psid=1)
 
 How many thousands of motorcycle deaths do you hear about each year?
Normally I feel bad, thinking that cars should pay more mind to the
other lesser-wheeled vehicle companions.
 
 Not so with this guy. This right here is why motorcyclists get killed.
It has nothing to do with a car's ability to see you and everything to
do with *obeying the fucking traffic laws*. Look, stud, you are a
vehicle on the road just like the rest of us. You have to ride in the
lane, just like the rest of us. If traffic is at a standstill or is
moving slowly, you're fucked just like the rest of us. You don't get to
skinny between cars regardless of your size. You, too, must sit and cook
in the heat.
 
 If someone had knocked this guy down, I wouldn't have stopped. In fact,
I'd have laughed. It sounds hard, but you get what you deserve. Obey the
law, dumbass, and maybe you'll live to ride your motorcycle tomorrow.
