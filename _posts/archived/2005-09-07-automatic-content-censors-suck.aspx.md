The concept of the automatic content censor (a la [Net
Nanny](http://www.netnanny.com) or
[CYBERsitter](http://www.cybersitter.com/)) is, for people with kids or
conservative attitudes, an intriguing one. It's like "anti-spam" for the
web.

 The thing is, they only *mostly* work, sort of the way spam filters
only *mostly* work. That's actually a real problem because with spam,
you don't have a choice - it floods into your email inbox without your
asking for it; with web sites, you have the choice of visiting a site or
not visiting it. Nobody's forcing you to visit that donkey porn site,
you should just know better.

 Again, for folks with kids, people like the idea of automated policing.
I'd like to think education would be a better solution, but I'm not the
parent of your kids.

 What's got me incensed about this today is [reading over at Raymond
Chen's
site](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/07/461914.aspx),
it seems that there's an Australian Internet cafe that is probably using
this software and it's blocking access to his site. I'm not sure what
reading about programming matters does against the sensitivities of a
child, but some automated content censor has deemed it inappropriate.
I'm sure I've probably been censored too (though I admit I've had my
moments language-wise, so it'd be more understandable, if annoying).

 While I'm not a fan of the whole content censor thing, I'd wager
over-censoring is a far greater sin than under-censoring. Oh, well. Do
what you gotta do, people.
