[![Zuma](https://hyqi8g.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y2piWj_izkDGhzi1wobDMkzZsODn9gY0fcbC_Zeky2uCr_LXwMcrew3qTeJNOnsF9OgD0wfdukMfo4bE2_aw71B9979ajiZ6_6iy1NSgRApz7Y/20060419zuma.jpg?psid=1)](http://www.popcap.com/zuma)Made
my first purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace last night. Bought the
game [*Zuma*](http://www.popcap.com/zuma), which is sort of an addictive
little puzzle game.
 
 I'd only played it a couple of times before - once on the computer,
once on the demo version for Xbox 360 - but I fired it up after buying
it for 800 "Microsoft Points" (\$10) and ran at it for a little over an
hour. Thought I was seriously kicking ass until I saw that I ranked like
20,000th or something. Hmmm.
 
 Jenn played after me. Jenn is a *Zuma whore*. Her *Zuma* addiction is
not unlike that of a heroin junkie. She did pretty well, better than I
did (ranking like 13,000th or something).
 
 So glad I paid \$600 for a *Zuma* 360 - a very expensive,
high-definition, *Zuma*-playing device. I anticipate she'll be on that
when I get home, her very soul lost to the chanting demons of the game,
eyes blurry, hands aching, just needing *one more game*.
