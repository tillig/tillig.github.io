I'm reading the back of the ["Yogurt & Green Onion" flavored Kettle
Chip](http://www.kettlefoods.com/ketus/prods/yogurt.htm) bag right now
and it says, as the "descriptive phrase" on the back:
 
 "Our Yogurt & Green Onion Kettle(tm) brand potato chips impart a farm
fresh flavor of creamy yogurt and green onion."
 
 Holy shit! I thought they'd taste like cheddar cheese! I'd best take
these back!
 
 I think Kettle Chips has a position open for a copywriter. Maybe I
should apply.
