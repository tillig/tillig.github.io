This weekend was pretty crazy with all the running around, but the major
goings-on included...

My mom got me a copy of *[The Simpsons
Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061231290?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061231290)*
through her work, but she was also able to get it slightly personalized
for me on the inside...

That's right - she got *Matt Groening himself* to sketch Bart on the
inside!  Far, far too cool.

While we were with them on Saturday, we went shopping for bicycles,
too.  Mom and Dad bought them for us as belated wedding gifts - far
better than a toaster!  Jenn and I have been wanting bikes for a while,
so we were pretty stoked.  Jenn ended up getting a [Giant
Sedona](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-US/bikes/lifestyle/939/28415/?collections_id=2)
and I got a [Giant
Cypress](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-US/bikes/lifestyle/1268/29329/). 
Jenn was able to bring hers home on Saturday, but mine's still getting
put together and should be done today.  I'll have to go in and pick it
up tonight or maybe tomorrow, pending on my schedule, from the local
[Bike n' Hike](http://bikenhike.com).

We're all geared up with helmets and bells and everything, ready to take
a ride.  The only things we really haven't gotten yet are locks and
racks (so, yes, we'll have to put my bike in the back of the car for
now).  We want the [Yakima KingJoe
2](http://www.yakima.com/Product.aspx?id=35) but we haven't been able to
find it anywhere around here.  Maybe we'll have to order it online. 
Anyway, I'll post pictures of the first ride when it happens.  I'm
excited.

My dad's brother and family were up here this weekend visiting from
California, so we got together with them, too.  It was nice to see them
again and demonstrate how thoroughly I trounce Dad at Xbox 360.
