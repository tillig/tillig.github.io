I decided this morning that I cannot stand patriotic art.
 
 There's some sort of local event going on to honor the memories of the
people who died in the 9/11 attacks (which I think is fine). Part of
that event has a sort of gallery of objects created in memory of these
people. The majority of this is what I would call "patriotic art."
 
 Patriotic art, at least in the US, is probably the most contrived form
of attempted emotional manipulation ever. You've all seen this in one
form or another in your lives. For US people, patriotic art looks like
this:
 
 Take an airbrush - it's always airbrushed - and draw a bald eagle.
Throw a waving US flag in there somewhere - maybe the eagle is carrying
it, maybe it's behind the eagle, maybe it's just blowing in the wind.
Doesn't matter - just put a flag in there. Now put one or more
soldiers/firefighters/police officers in the picture in a position that
looks like they're overcoming impossible odds. If you choose soldiers,
you have your choice of wars: Revolutionary, WWII, Vietnam, or Desert
Storm. Make sure any soldiers you have in the picture are carrying
rifles. Now throw some blue sky and the optional "POW/MIA" flag in there
and you have patriotic art.
 
 You can see this crap, larger than life, printed on t-shirts, motor
vehicles, or inspirational posters.
 
 I'm as patriotic as the next guy. I feel bad when tragedy strikes and
I'm proud when the citizens of our country rise up together to overcome
difficult times. But I can not - nay, *will not* - stand for this
ridiculous form of art anymore. It's not an homage, it's a disgrace. I
don't care if you successfully completed [the free art test from the
correspondence school](http://www.artists-ais.com/free/index.shtml).
This is crap.
