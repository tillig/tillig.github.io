My kitchen is clean! Yay, me! [Horizon
Restoration](http://www.horizonrestoration.com/) came in yesterday and
cleaned our kitchen, so the nasty soot crap isn't all over everything
anymore. In fact, they organized stuff a bit, too, so it's easier to
find everything. Pretty sweet, if you ask me.
 
 They'll be taking our electronics for sonic cleaning some time next
week and will bring them back the following week.
 
 I found a new show on [The Discovery
Channel](http://www.discovery.com/) that I like. Not that I needed
another show to watch, of course. *[Monster
Garage](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/monstergarage/monstergarage.html)*
is sort of like a combination of *[Junkyard
Wars](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/junkyard/junkyard.html)* and
*[Trading
Spaces](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html)*,
but... not...
 
 In *Monster Garage*, a team of mechanics and designers convert everyday
cars into funky machines. Like, in one episode, they convert a
[Volkswagen Beetle into a swamp
skiff](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/monstergarage/episode/episode_03.html).
In another, they [convert a limousine into a fire
truck](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/monstergarage/episode/episode_02.html).
It's pretty slick to see what these people can do. Gives you a total
appreciation for people who know their stuff; I wouldn't have a clue
where to begin on something like that.
 
 Anyway, I'm sucked into that one.
 
 On a side note, while we're on the topic of shows like *Trading
Spaces*, does anyone out there think that
[Laurie](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/bio/bio_06.html)
and [Amy
Wynn](http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/bio/bio_09.html)
are as hot as *I* think they are? :)
