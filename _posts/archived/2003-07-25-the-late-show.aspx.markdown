Got home after work last night and planned on just sitting around as I
usually do (oh so motivated am I) and maybe studying a little, but stuff
happened.

 First, a good friend of mine stopped by who I haven't seen for a while
and gave me a belated birthday gift that was far above and beyond
anything I could have asked for, and it was very hard for me to accept
(but, hey, twist my arm...): A 15GB [Apple iPod MP3
Player](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/70307/wo/SJ26UdD57A0R37IGbhA1fW3b4IM/0.0.7.1.0.5.13.0.1.1.3.0.7.1.1.1.0).

 Needless to say, I was shocked, but I thanked him for it several times,
and I still don't think that's enough. That's, like, the coolest thing
*ever*.

 Then later on, my friend (and boss) Greg called and we ended up going
to see the late showing of [*Terminator
3*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181852).

 You gotta love *T3*. The first one was a classic, and the second was
great but took itself pretty seriously. In this one, you could tell they
had fun with it. The director (or writer, or both, or maybe just
everyone on board) was all, "Hey! This may be a story about the
destruction of humanity, but it's also an *action film*, so what say we
blow some shit up? Get the SWAT team in here, God dammit! Where are
those bazookas? They were supposed to be here *hours ago*!" I think this
was probably my favorite of the three, just because it was all about the
*fun* of the action movie and not about teaching us a lesson. Deep? No.
Fun? You better believe it.

 Oh, and my sister Tori in Utah called and left me a happy birthday
voicemail yesterday. Better late than never(?).

 So, a day after my birthday (well, *two days*, if you count today) and
maybe things aren't so bad. I mean, I guess sometimes it just takes
people a while to "catch up" or whatever. Heh.
