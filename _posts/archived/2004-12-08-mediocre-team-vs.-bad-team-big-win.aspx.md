Went to the [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com/) game last night,
and while I insist that this season's Hawks are mediocre at best, the
[Swift Current Broncos](http://www.scbroncos.com/) suck, so we kicked
their ass 4 - 0.

 It was nice to see such a blowout win, but I won't lie: it'd be nice if
it was *good hockey*. Connect a pass, guys. Come on. You can do it. At
least there were a couple of good fights.

 You'll notice that I've turned on the requirement for folks to register
prior to adding comments. I came in and looked at the 50 comment spams I
had gotten and realized I had to do something, especially since it was
still happening while I was reading email. I turned on the registration
to stop the spider from adding more comments (they were going down the
list of every single entry and adding comments).

 I may or may not remove that registration requirement. I don't actually
send anything out to the email list, so maybe I'll just leave it. It'd
be nice to know how many folks come in. Then again, I should probably
take the effort and implement my lame almost-CAPTCHA "copy and paste
this random word" solution. It's not foolproof by any means, but I
figure my site's not big enough for folks to invest the time and figure
out how to sidestep it. I suppose if they ever do invest that time, I'll
have to move to a solution that actually supports
[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha)s.
