I just got this company-wide email that there's a surprise party for the
guy who just got promoted from President of the company to President
*and CEO*. This gets me to thinking (as I am wont to do)...

 Nobody throws parties for me or my group. We're the IT people. If stuff
breaks, we hear about it. When things work, someone else gets the
credit. Now I get this notice that this guy got promoted from making
way-too-much money a year to more-money-than-I'll-see-in-my-lifetime a
year, and *he* gets a party?

 This whole thing rubs me the wrong way. I mean, this is like throwing a
party for the cast of a successful Broadway production and not inviting
the stage hands. You *rely* on the stage hands and technical crew. If
they don't do their job right, the stars of the show look bad and the
whole production fails. But who gets the kudos? The asshole on stage who
can barely remember his lines.

 I suppose I should just accept the fact that I, like most folks out
there, am in a totally thankless position. I suppose I should just move
on with life. But stuff like this bugs me, like, on a *gut level*. This
guy would be President and CEO of Cardboard Box Land if it wasn't for
people like me and my group.

 Consider me pissed off.
