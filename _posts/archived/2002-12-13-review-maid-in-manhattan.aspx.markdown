[*Maid In Manhattan*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0252076) is the story of
a hotel maid, Marisa Ventura ([Jennifer
Lopez](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Lopez,%20Jennifer)), who meets a rich
politician, Christopher Marshall ([Ralpf
Fiennes](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Fiennes,%20Ralph)). He doesn't realize
she's a maid, they fall in love, she gets exposed, they fall apart, then
they come back together.
 
 That's pretty much it.
 
 *Maid in Manhattan* is the epitome of formulaic filmmaking. I could
have written this myself in my spare time at work by printing out
*Cinderella* and changing the names. Not ten minutes into the show, you
can see what roles everyone plays in the story and you know exactly
what's going to happen. If you've seen it once, you've seen it a
thousand times. As such, I won't go into the plot. You know the story
already. If you don't, you've been living in a cave.
 
 What I will say is this: It wasn't as bad *as all that*. I mean, as far
as Cinderella stories go, this was an okay rendition. I'm not a big J.Lo
fan, so I'm not giving extra credit that she was in it; pretty much
anyone could have played any of the roles in this thing and it'd still
have come out the same.
 
 This was definitely a chick flick. Jenn walked out thinking it was
pretty good. I don't necessarily disagree, but I do think she liked it
more than I did. After all, she is the proud owner of way too many
[Julia Roberts](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Roberts,+Julia) DVDs.
 
 I saw it for free on a sneak preview and I'm glad I didn't pay the full
evening price for it. I could maybe see going on the matinee for a lunch
date or something, but in the end, I'd say wait until it comes out and
rent it. Save your money and go to [*Die Another
Day*](/archive/2002/11/25/review-die-another-day.aspx) instead.
