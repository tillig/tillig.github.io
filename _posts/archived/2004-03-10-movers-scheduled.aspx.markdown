My original plan was to rent a U-Haul truck, move the small stuff
myself, then hire [some guys](http://www.powermovers.com) to come and
load/unload the heavy stuff.
 
 After calculating it out, it would only cost a couple hundred more
bucks to get a [full-service outfit](http://www.alliedvan.com/) to do
the whole thing (minus packing).
 
 So I called up and canceled my truck rental reservation and now the
moving company will show up at 9:00a, truck and all, ready to go. I just
need to be supervisory/moral support and the work will all be done for
me. That's exactly how I like it. Hopefully this will take the sucky
lameness out of moving so I can focus on the positive portion of things.
Plus, these guys are hooking me up with some boxes, so I can start the
packing process right away. I like that.
 
 I've contacted my apartment complex to get the paint color I need to
repaint my walls to (we have a cobalt blue wall in the living room that
Jenn and I painted up) and it turns out they're just going to leave us
some paint to use, so we just have to go get some primer and a couple of
rollers. Good deal.
 
 Finally, the escrow company mailed me a receipt for my earnest money
check, so I know that's all going according to plan.
