I got to thinking this morning in the car on my way to work that I
commute probably 30 to 60 minutes each way to work and that's sort of a
waste of time. I'm starting to consider getting some sort of "Learn
Language X on Tape (or CD)" package so I can maybe learn something while
I'm wasting time getting to work.
 
 I mentioned this to a couple of the guys at work and they claimed that
music was enough for them. I thought about that, and I guess I like
listening to music on my way to work, but I need a big variety and I
always want something new. I love all the CDs I have now (and I have
quite a few) but I always crave something new and different.
 
 That led me to think maybe one of those CD clubs like [Columbia
House](http://www.columbiahouse.com/) or [BMG](http://www.bmgmusic.com/)
might be an idea. The problem with clubs, though, is twofold: First, I
will never remember to return the stupid card every month in the mail
that tells them not to send the damn "CD Of The Month" to me; Second,
the selection there is lacking. Searching for "[Kylie
Minogue](http://www.kylie.com/)," for example, on either of the two
aforementioned clubs yields no results. Not so hot, especially
considering that my taste in music is usually not as mainstream as they
offer. Are there any better clubs out there?
 
 So for now, I'm still pondering what to do. Something has to be done
since my commute is the lamest part of my day, hands down. And, no, I'm
*not* moving closer to work. Not if I can help it. I hate it in
Hillsboro.
