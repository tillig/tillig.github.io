I've started actually (*gasp*) hearing back from some of these mortgage
brokers that I've been trying to get in contact with, so I decided to
put up a new category - *Realty Check* - to include my home-buying
experience (and probably, after that, home maintenance experience). I'm
sure it'll be old hat to the people out there who have already bought
homes, but if anything, it'll be good for me to look back on and laugh.
 
 Plus, maybe I can sell book rights to it. Heh.
