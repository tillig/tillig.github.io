I'm trying to figure out what people are using in
[CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) (and what they're
not) so I know where I can focus my attention (and what I can nuke from
the codebase). If you are a CR\_Documentor user and you have a couple of
seconds, can you take my eight-question survey on it?

[Go to the survey site](http://www.AdvancedSurvey.com) and use **survey
number 68141**.
