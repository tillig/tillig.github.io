[![The Big Bang Theory - Season
1](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81Q4YEuPKwL._SL500_AA240_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91RUG?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000W91RUG)Some
friends of mine at work told me I needed to watch *[The Big Bang
Theory](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91RUG?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000W91RUG)*
because I resembled one of the characters. After a couple of mentions of
this, I gave in and got the first season from Netflix.

Before we started watching, I sat my wife down and told her we needed to
figure out which character I resemble. Up to the task, we started the
disc.

About 10 minutes into the first episode, we had a conversation like
this:

**Jenn**: You're Sheldon.
 **Travis**: What? Are you sure? I could be Leonard.
 **Jenn**: You're Sheldon.
 **Travis**: I dunno... HOLY CRAP I'M SHELDON.

After watching the first six episodes, I have to say that while I have
some Leonard in me, I'm Sheldon. Like [this video where Penny sits in
Sheldon's
seat](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/video/video.php?cid=501654023&pid=VwbP6mQ_rwV16kRGUCoPXizB5p2d0iGx&play=true&cc=2)...
I think I've actually had this conversation, or something eerily like
it. (Though mine was more around my parking spot at work than my seat at
home.)

Anyway, it's a great show, so if you haven't seen it, check it out. I'll
be watching the rest as they come in from Netflix.
