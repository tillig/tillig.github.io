It's been a bit over a year [since I posted about my hair removal
progress](/archive/2008/07/14/laser-hair-removal-treatment-12.aspx) and
as I just finished up treatment \#26 a week or so ago, I thought I'd
recap a bit... if anything, as a note to self.

I started the process of getting my facial hair removed [a little over
two years ago](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx).
My facial hair is, to put it mildly, very coarse and causes all nature
of dermatological issues if I let it grow even a little bit, not to
mention it destroys sheets, pillowcases, necks on shirts, etc.

Hair removal is painful. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The more
coarse your hair, the worse it is.

To that end, I started the first few treatments using a [Dermo
Flash](http://sanadome.nl/sanadomeEN/health/dermoflash.html), which is a
less painful, more broad-spectrum sort of hair removal system. That
helped to thin things down, but after the first few treatments we saw
diminishing returns because it wasn't powerful enough. I then switched
to a
[MeDioStar](http://www.asclepion.com/root_corporate/mediostar_corporate_ENG_Corporate.aspx)
laser-based treatment which was much more effective but also much more
painful.

Since then, I've been alternating between the MeDioStar and a [Syneron
eLaser](http://www.syneron.com/products/elaser) that combines laser and
radio frequency. I've been having good results with this, with some
spots on my chin and upper lip being the only stubborn areas we're still
working on.

Something to think about if you're considering getting this done: You're
in for the long haul. That's not just if you're getting your face done,
but anywhere. They can do a lot in a few treatments, but you're not
going in for five or six treatments and calling it good if you want to
actually clear an area out. And once you've started, you can't really
turn back because you start getting patchy and it doesn't look all that
great.

Also, even today, it still hurts. Not nearly as bad as it did in my
first treatment, but it hurts. On the upper lip it's enough to bring
tears to your eyes.

Had I known all that... I probably still would have done it. I don't get
the nasty ingrowns like I used to, I don't tear up my pillowcases
anymore, and I can kiss my wife without removing the top layer of her
skin with my sandpaper beard.

I have a few more treatments (a total of 30) and we'll see where I'm at
then.
