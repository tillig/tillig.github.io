For those who ever doubted (including myself) and those who ever
wondered, let it be proclaimed throughout the land that ***I AM THE
DATABASE MASTAH!!!*** We gots the *tools*, we gots the *talent*. Maaaaad
skillz, I tell you.

 [Translation: I passed my test, *MS070-229 - Designing and Implementing
Databases with MicrosoftÂ® SQL Server<sup>TM</sup> 2000 Enterprise Edition*.]

 I studied all last week, I studied this weekend, and I studied this
morning before heading into the test center. I was still pretty nervous
during the test (I'm glad I didn't eat anything because I would have
launched right onto the test machine) but as the thing went on, I
realized that I *knew the answers to the questions*. They were the same
questions in the practice tests. No problem.

 Finished the 44 questions on the test in about an hour. Considering
they give you two hours for the test, I think that's pretty good. In the
end, I got a PASS score. They used to give you actual scores to tell you
how many you got wrong, but now it's just PASS/FAIL. No problem for me,
PASS is PASS, baby.

 So. One down, four to go. I think the next test I'll take will probably
be the Windows Apps in C\# test. I'd best get cracking on that.
