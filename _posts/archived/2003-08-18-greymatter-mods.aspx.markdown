So I just did a little hacking on the Greymatter source code so now I
have some additional functionality:

-   In the configuration, there's a spot where you can specify your
    Amazon Affiliate ID (for link creation)
-   When you add or edit an entry, you can hit CTRL-SHIFT-E to create a
    link to an Amazon product by entering the ASIN for the product
-   Links that you add to other sites, etc., all open in a new window by
    default

I'm pretty pleased. This makes it much more usable, especially for the
way I blog.
