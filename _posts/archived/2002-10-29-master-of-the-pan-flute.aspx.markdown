I will admit that random thoughts cross my mind when I'm in the car.
 
 For example, today I was driving along, listening to my [*Police:
Live*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002G2E/mhsvortex)
album, and one of the songs (I don't remember which) had a pan flute
going in the background. The first thought in my head when I heard that
was *not* "hey, that's nice and relaxing," nor was it "wow, that sounds
like [Men At
Work](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WK3X/mhsvortex)."
 
 It was: *I wonder what ever happened to
[Zamfir](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=mhsvortex&path=tg/stores/artist/glance/-/39166/)?*
 
 I remember being bombarded by *Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute*
advertisements while sitting on the green shag carpet of my
grandparents' house, watching the [Magnavox](http://www.magnavox.com/)
console TV (remember those?) and eating
[Cheetos](http://www.fritolay.com/consumer/funfoods/products/cheetos.html).
(That was around the same time that [Roger
Whittaker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000D8S/mhsvortex)
was huge, and I can still visualize the back-to-back
*call-this-1-800-number-now* commercials.)
 
 My grandmother on my mom's side was still alive back then and she'd let
us pick the pennies out of her change bowl to keep. I can still see her
sitting, smoking, at the kitchen table in their old house. Always
smoking. That's actually what did her in, in the end.
 
 Whoa, flashback there.
 
 Anyway, Zamfir. What happened to the guy? Was there just no more demand
for pan flute music? *Was there ever* a demand for pan flute music, or
was it this manufactured market that he catered to? Like somehow he
convinced these record companies that there'd be this huge run on pan
flautists so they'd best snatch him up and make some albums.
 
 By the time I had gotten this far in the thought process, I was at my
allergy shot appointment so I dropped it.
 
 If anyone out there ever bought or listened to a Zamfir album, drop me
a comment.
