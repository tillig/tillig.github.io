This entry is a big **thank you** to Jenn for being *soooo* helpful and
observant this morning. It's also a good illustration of how badly and
easily I get sidetracked.
 
 After I got out of the shower this morning, Jenn let our baby Xev cat
into the bedroom. Xev climbed my towel (while it was wrapped around me)
up onto the counter and Jenn got in the shower. So far, so good. I got
myself ready while watching the cat. The cat likes it when you turn the
water on in the sink so it just barely runs - she sticks her foot in it,
shakes it off, then does it again. She also likes to try to eat your
toothbrush, destroy the [Dixie
cup](http://www.gp.com/consumerproducts/dixie.html) dispenser on the
counter, etc. So while I was getting ready, putting on my deodorant,
putting the gel in my hair, and so on, I was watching the cat and
laughing.
 
 There are about 20 minutes between Jenn getting out of the shower and
me leaving. During those 20 minutes, Jenn and I are in the same room
(the bedroom) getting our respective selves dressed and so forth. After
that, I pack up and leave, Jenn shutting the door behind me.
 
 I just now went into the bathroom at work. Took a leak, washed my
hands, washed my face and...
 
 **WHY DIDN'T I COMB MY HAIR TODAY???**
 
 I've got hair running all over the place. It looks a lot like it does
when I get up in the morning, but now it's conveniently gelled into
place. Fucking great. Permanent bed head.
 
 Now, I'm not shirking the responsibility for this hair debacle. I'm
sure I just got sidetracked stopping the cat from destroying something.
But there was *another human in the room who could have said something*.
Is my hair that messy all the time that it's not noticeable when I comb
it and when I don't? Shit, people, *say something*.
 
 I don't have a comb at work. The best I can do is try to wet it and
sort of beat it down with my hands. Dammit! Now what?
 
 Okay, here's a sidetrack for you: In the event you want to send pizza
and Pepsi to a patrol, section, or entire platoon of Israeli soldiers,
you can do so at [PizzaIDF.org](http://www.pizzaidf.org/). You can also
send ice cream or burgers. Apparently there's a web site for
*everything* nowadays. To be honest, sending pizza to Israelis never
even crossed my mind before. Where's the site to send pizza and Pepsi to
*me?* (Actually, I guess this is it. But it doesn't directly *advertise*
the opportunity to send me food. Maybe I should step that up a bit.)
