There's something about porn spam in my Inbox that just gives me the
warm fuzzies. Especially the myriad ads for "Enhance Your Penis" or
"Extra Length!" That's just great. Please, send me more of those because
you know as well as I do that I click on *every single one* of them and
find them all worthwhile.
 
 **NOT.**
 
 Some are legitimately clever, though. I think my favorite recent one
had the subject, "Satisfy your woman you pindick." That definitely makes
me want to click it. Morons. People who spam people should be fucking
shot.
 
 Okay, so I found some GBA accessories I need to get...

-   **MP3 Player** - This actually comes in two varieties: the
    [SongPro](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=232091)
    (\$100) and the
    [Innovation](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=228110)
    (\$60). The SongPro is better with more features and higher quality
    sound, so obviously that's the way I'd like to go.
-   **[TV
    Converter](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=219897)**
    - So you can play the game on the TV instead of on the little
    screen.
-   **[Personal
    Organizer](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=230469)**
    - Turn your GBA into a PDA...
-   **[Macro
    Kit](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=234083)**
    - A kit with a small carrying case, a headphone adapter, headphones,
    and a car charger. At \$15, I think I'll probably just order this
    and call it a day.
-   **[Ergo
    Grips](http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=234008)**
    - Hand grips that attach to the GBA to relieve cramps.
-   **[Flash Advance Card](http://www.gba-flash-card.tk/)** - A card
    that allows you to put downloadable game ROMs on it and then play
    them on your GBA.

By the way, I'm still loving my GBA SP. However, I'm realizing that, as
simple as the unit is, that doesn't make the games any easier. I'm still
as bad at Mario Brothers games as I ever was. That doesn't make it any
less fun, though.
