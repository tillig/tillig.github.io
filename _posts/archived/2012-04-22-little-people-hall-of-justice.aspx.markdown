Phoenix is really into the Fisher Price "Little People" figures,
particularly [the DC Super Friends
line](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FA311A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005FA311A).
She doesn't know a lot of words, [but she knows "Bapmo!" (Batman) and
loves flying them around the
room](/archive/2012/03/15/a-typical-play-session-with-my-toddler.aspx).

A while ago we got her [the Batcave
playset](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ORYVAU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004ORYVAU)
so she'd have some additional vehicles and stuff, not just figures.
This, of course, led to also getting [Wonder Woman's invisible
jet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076YQHEQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0076YQHEQ)
and [the
Batmobile](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076OJOF0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0076OJOF0).
(OK, maybe it doesn't hurt that *we both* like the Super Friends. Come
on, when your 18-month-old runs around yelling about Batman, that's
pretty sweet.)

The proliferation of Super-Friends-related items started lending itself
to a bit of a storage dilemma, and on top of that, I started [thinking
back to the
cartoons](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W2C28Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000W2C28Y)...
How can you have the Super Friends without the Hall of Justice?

![The cartoon Hall of
Justice](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pTyXU2W2t3OJ5_60JsAo5BGrLYOHn9mkautlniscc-F4JBtZHVfBpADJQvhWJTt74bVfgdaTIu2LdVWr9K-Sx5WIk1EAw12_u09VT62NUr1c/20120422_cartoonhall.jpg?psid=1)

So I took a cardboard box, went to the craft store and picked up some
supplies... and I present to you: The Little People Hall of Justice!

The main form is just a cardboard box. The outside is covered in a thin
white foam that makes it soft. I lined the inside with tagboard and
added a fold-down flap that Velcros shut so you can play inside. The
windows on the front are blue tagboard behind some cutouts in the foam.
The edges of the cardboard are lined with twill tape to avoid any
cardboard cuts. I reinforced the top with additional cardboard so it's
not quite climb-proof, but it should stand up to some reasonable amount
of abuse.

[I posted several views of it in the photo album if you're
interested.](https://picasaweb.google.com/100275637557074554059/20120422HallOfJustice?authuser=0&feat=directlink)
The pictures have captions that explain how things are put together...
in case you want to make your own.
