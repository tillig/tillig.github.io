I woke up on this fine *birthday morning*, 27 years old and tired as all
hell.
 
 My shower was nothing spectacular, but when I got out, I found I had a
[little
present](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006JSS8/mhsvortex)
from Jenn waiting for me, which is nice - I do enjoy prizes.
 
 The trip to work sucked ass. I can't tell you why everyone needed to go
five miles an hour under the limit, but they all did.
 
 Got to work, and... well, that's pretty self-explanatory. I got to
work. 'Nuff said.
 
 Actually accomplished some good stuff at work. Got a bunch of things
set up that needed to get set up, rolled out a press release on the web
site. I felt pretty accomplished.
 
 Thought about halfway through the day about the fact that my hair's
feeling pretty shaggy and I should have a haircut coming up. Flipped
through my calendar and saw that the appointment was scheduled for
yesterday. Well, shit. I suppose I should call the hairdresser (who's
been doing my hair for 14 years now) and apologize. I totally spaced it,
and I do need a haircut. I could have sworn I looked at the calendar
yesterday and didn't see it.
 
 But now it's the end of the day, and no one remembered my birthday
until one guy was looking over my shoulder and saw it marked on my
calendar. Word trickled out and I'm getting a few "happy birthdays" from
people. Some folks never knew, so I can't blame them, but still. I guess
I feel a little disappointed; I mean, we take everyone else out for
lunch on their birthdays, and everyone seems to remember the other
birthdays.
 
 My boss came over and was all, "Oh, today's your birthday? I thought it
was yesterday." Yeah, man. That makes it better. :) He says he owes me
lunch. He owes me about four lunches that never seem to get scheduled,
so I'm not holding my breath. He's a good guy, and busy, so I
understand. But still.
 
 Now I'm packing up to go home, where I'll hang out with Jenn, my
parents, my sister and her husband, and maybe my grandfather, eat some
Chinese food and some cheesecake, and just enjoy the evening. It doesn't
sound like the most happening party, I know, but I have [bad luck
scheduling parties](/archive/2003/02/10/reliable-irritation.aspx), so I
just don't.
 
 Besides - deep fried prawns and a hunk of cheesecake all at the same
time is like a tiny party in-and-of-itself.
 
 One other note: Last night I took a practice certification test and got
92% on it, which is the best I've done yet. If I can do that well on the
real thing this Monday, I'll be good.
