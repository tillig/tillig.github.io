I just got sucked in to a four-hour-long meeting tomorrow.

 I'm not a big meeting person. I have about a 30 minute (tops) attention
span at meetings, regardless of my level of involvement in them, so
after about half an hour I'm ready to check out - I've lost all interest
in whatever topic it is and I'll pretty much say or do whatever it takes
to get *out* of the meeting.

 On top of that, I'm a firm believer that good results are rarely
achieved by meetings. Sure, there are a few good meetings that happen,
but by-and-large, going to a meeting is like convening a congressional
hearing - it takes forever to hear all the sides to every story, and
then some arbitrary decision is made by committee that I really don't
care about.

 I just don't do well with meetings.

 So I'm not too thrilled about being called into a four-hour-long
meeting. I think that's probably why I'm not in management and my career
could potentially be considered "limited" - I want to focus on *doing*,
not *planning to plan the plan*.

 It really doesn't help that the meeting is about the next phase of this
project I just got off of that burned me out 110% on web development of
any nature. I was starting to get my groove back, and I even put a
couple of cool things (what I think are cool) out here for folks to
download and use... I was starting to feel that desire to create cool
stuff again.

 There goes *that*. And I was just starting to enjoy myself.

 I guess the best I can hope for now is to die in my sleep. Or at least
not have unreasonable deadlines on the stuff I have to get done (which
is, I think, the aim of the ridiculous four-hour meeting).
