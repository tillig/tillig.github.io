Turns out I don't have a head cold, I have hay fever unlike anything
I've had in a long time. Jenn's got the same thing. She went to her
doctor for a cold treatment and got told it was allergies. My allergy
shot clinic confirmed that a lot of folks have gotten hit in the last
week. I have since upped my antihistamine dosage.

 I got a new cable box today. This will be the
[third](/archive/2004/04/07/moved-in.aspx)
[one](/archive/2004/04/09/cable-fixed.aspx) we've had since we moved in.
The first one had crackly sound, this last one decided it would turn
itself off and reset itself every time you change the channel. The one I
got today seems to work OK; let's hope it stays that way.

 While waiting for the cable guy, I decided to test the toilet in the
downstairs bathroom for leaking (I can hear it run very slightly every
so often). I dropped some food coloring in the tank and, sure enough,
found it in the bowl very shortly after. Guess I've gotta look at that
when I get home. It's always something.
