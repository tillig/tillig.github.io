Even using [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) for anti-blog-spam (which
seems to work pretty well), I've noticed that as far as
trackbacks/pingbacks are concerned, I only get two types:

1. One of my own articles tracking back to itself for
    cross-referencing.
2. Spam that slips through Akismet.

So I've disabled trackbacks because they're just a pain in my ass to
moderate.  If anyone can provide a decent argument why I should
re-enable them, I'm all ears.  Comment away.  (Comments are still
enabled.)
