I've been using this program called [DVD
Profiler](http://www.intervocative.com/dvdpro/Info.aspx) to keep track
of the DVDs I have. It's nice to have an easy to browse catalog, and
it's great to print off periodic reports for insurance purposes. Plus
there's an ad-supported free version that does pretty much everything
you want it to do.
 
 I've had it for a while and dig it, so I registered it for the \$30.
It's a one-time thing with no upgrade cost, so I figured what the heck -
I use it and like it, right?
 
 Registering allows you to upload your DVD collection to their site.
[Now you can see which movies I
have](http://www.intervocative.com/dvdcollection.aspx/tillig), and I can
make sure I don't run out to Target at lunch and get something I already
have. If the family wants to see something, they can look at the list
and borrow it from me instead of renting. Pretty cool, if I do say so
myself.
