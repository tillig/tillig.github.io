I have my car insurance through
[Progressive](http://www.progressive.com), which, all lame TV
commercials aside, has meant excellent service and the best prices
around. Not to mention their web site is exceptionally comprehensive and
simple to use - I can't ask for much more.
 
 My homeowner's insurance company, [State
Farm](http://www.statefarm.com/), called me up today and wanted to see
if they could save me some money on my auto insurance. So I went through
the gamut of questions, told them all of my driving history and such, at
least according to what Progressive looks at, and gave them my coverage
numbers so they could give me an apples-to-apples comparison.
 
 *With* all of the discounts and such for multi-policy and safe driver
and all that, *State Farm was still \$600/year more expensive than
Progressive*.
 
 Once again, I sing the praises of Progressive auto insurance. If your
policy is coming up, I couldn't recommend more that you check them out.
It will be well worth your time.
