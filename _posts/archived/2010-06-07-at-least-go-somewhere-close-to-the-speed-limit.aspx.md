It's been a while since [my last traffic-related
posting](/archive/2008/09/19/watch-those-one-way-grids.aspx), mostly
because my commute in recent years has been pretty short so I don't have
those "Traffic Asshole of the Week" moments to post. Today, though, I
found THIS guy:

![20 in a 45? Sure! Why
not?](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pov6GodJw9CIDut00DK7LUpNtet04ReO-hUOSAwGUgMx1BmW4fg-gf_FYhCZJvU-jU5YixVQk3bTdsHc4CzJA9juu9zZRtpc2cwVgYJ26Pis/20100607taotw.jpg?psid=1)Â 

This giant GMC truck *made my traffic day*. If you, too, want to make my
day in the same way, here's how:

1.  While I'm going a full 45mph, wait until I'm a little less than half
    a block away and then do a left-hand turn out of a side street and
    cut me off.
2.  Once you've cut me off, make sure and go somewhere around 20mph in a
    45mph speed zone. Be sure this is in a no-passing area, too, so
    there's no way I can get around you.
3.  Do not put on your emergency flashers to indicate you're going slow
    on purpose. Make sure that, by all appearances, you're really just
    not paying any attention at all to the whole "driving experience."
4.  Stop for every green light. Seriously. Stop for anything that says
    "go."
5.  Every time I signal to change lanes, to get around you, go ahead
    and, without signaling, change lanes in front of me into the lane I
    was going for.

After I finally got around him (where there were finally two lanes), I
looked in my rear view mirror and saw cars passing him in one lane like
he was standing still... and somewhere over 10 or 15 cars piled up
behind him, waiting for a chance to jam into the next lane and get
around.

Dude, you are the single-handed reason for traffic. Pull over to the
side of the road, take the keys out of the ignition, and throw them as
hard as you can into the scrub. Walk home. You are fired as a driver.
