With our new dishwasher in the house, we no longer have the problem
where our cups and glasses get "etched" because of crappy wash cycle, so
we decided to get some new glasses.

 I love huge glasses. Like, pint or larger is perfect. We found [a set
of pub glasses at Linens 'N
Things](http://www.lnt.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1419473) that are
20 oz. glasses. Love it. We threw 'em in the new dishwasher, washed 'em,
and they look spectacular.

 Got one out to use it for the first time last night. We have one of
those refrigerators that has the water in the door. I wanted a glass of
water. Pub glasses to the rescue!

 Turns out, maybe these glasses are a little too big. Here's a diagram
(not to scale) of what I'm talking about.

 No matter how I twist or turn that thing, I can't get it in the door
far enough to hit the button to get the water out. I actually have to
reach my finger in there to depress the button.

 I suppose that's a small price to pay, but I won't say I'm not a little
peeved. I didn't consider having to buy glasses based on the size of the
opening in the refrigerator door. Bah!
