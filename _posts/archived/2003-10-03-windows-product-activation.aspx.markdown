I've run into my first major issue with Windows Product Activation, and
as far as I'm concerned, this is *fucking ridiculous*.
 
 I took the last two days to build up my new desktop workstation here at
work. I installed everything, configured everything, set everything up
*just so*. Worked great.
 
 After all that, I was given a larger hard drive to install. Cool,
right? So I ghosted my existing installation, swapped drives, and put
the ghosted image onto the new drive. Done.
 
 Boot up, log in, and... Windows can't validate my license. My *volume
license that shouldn't need validating*.
 
 I'm running a repair on the installation right now to see if that fixes
it. If it doesn't, well... I guess I've got a project for the weekend. I
can't allocate any more time to it next week, and I need this thing
running by Monday.
 
 Fucking hell.
