You know those stupid questionnaires that you get that your friends send
you in email that ask you a bazillion questions so you can "get to know
each other better?"

 Yeah, you know 'em.

 I hate those.

 Of course, I feel strangely compelled to answer the questions at the
same time, though. I'm not sure why, really. Maybe I feel the need to
share because they shared with me. Either way, this time I got one and I
decided to share my answers here, so I don't have to try to remember
everyone's email addresses or perpetuate the junk mail. If someone wants
to see my answers, they can come to the site.

 So here you go.

1. **If you could build a house anywhere, where would it be?**
     That's a tough one. I've never really *been* anywhere, so I can't
    really say. But I suppose, given the choice, I'd probably choose
    either somewhere in Paris or maybe Rome. I should probably visit
    those places before committing to anything, though.
2. **What's your favorite article of clothing?**
     My Spider-Man baseball jersey. I also like my [Winter
    Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) jersey.
3. **Favorite physical feature of the opposite sex?**
     Yow. I have to say "bust," like "statue" sort of "bust" - kind of
    from the armpits up. I have sort of an eye/teeth ratio that needs to
    be maintained - if you have great eyes but crappy teeth, you won't
    fly with me. Great teeth and ugly eyes don't work, either. I've also
    got a thing for nice hair, especially if it's been put up and has
    those little wispy bits flowing down around the ears. All of these
    features may be overridden partially by a nice display of cleavage,
    though.
4. **What's the last CD that you bought?**
     I bought [Kylie Minogue's *Hits
    +*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000649MT/mhsvortex) and
    [Michelle Branch's *The Spirit
    Room*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005M987/mhsvortex)
    at the same time.
5. **Where's your favorite place to be?**
     At the movies.
6. **Where's your least favorite place to be?**
     Gigantic family events; or events where there are a large number of
    people that I don't know, don't really *want* to know, yet am
    expected to mingle with. Yes, this includes holidays.
7. **What's your favorite place to be massaged?**
     On the inside of my forearms.
8. **Strong in mind or strong in body?**
     Definitely strong in mind. I sit on my ass all day long
    programming. I'm a huge wuss.
9. **What time do you wake in the morning?**
     6:30a
10. **What's your favorite kitchen appliance?**
     The microwave has some serious appeal, though we just bought this
    giant cheese grater that I've grown an affinity for.
11. **What makes you really angry?**
     Way too much, probably. I really hate people who won't listen to me
    when I know I'm right. I'm not right all the time or anything, and
    I'll be the first to admit when I'm wrong... but when I *know* I'm
    right, you need to listen or there will be *problems*. I also hate
    bad drivers, and that means just about everyone else on the road.
12. **If you could play any instrument, what would it be?**
     Drums.
13. **Favorite color?**
     Used to be green, then red... now I'm liking blue. Like, cobalt,
    French blue.
14. **Which do you prefer, sports car or SUV?**
     Sports car. People who drive SUVs most likely don't need the
    four-wheel drive or the space it offers, so all it does is suck up
    gas and fuck up our natural resources. Don't even *talk* to me if
    you own one of those damn Ford Expedition gas guzzlers. I feel the
    same way about large pickup trucks. Also, most folks who own SUVs
    don't know how to drive them. If you own the car, *learn to fucking
    park it*. On the other hand, sports cars can be made to be
    gas-efficient, and the people who own sports cars usually know how
    to at least park them.
15. **Do you believe in afterlife?**
     As in, "Heaven?" Yeah, I do. Not so sure about reincarnation,
    though.
16. **Favorite children's book?**
     [*The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins* by Dr.
    Seuss](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/039484484X/mhsvortex)
17. **What is your favorite season?**
     Summer.
18. **What's your least favorite household chore?**
     Anything to do with yard work. Mowing, raking leaves, spreading
    barkdust. It's all one big suckfest.
19. **If you could have one super power, what would it be?**
     Telekinesis.
20. **If you have a tattoo, what is it?**
     No tattoos. No plan on getting any, either.
21. **Can you juggle?**
     Yup, but only three or fewer items.
22. **The one person from your past you wish you could go back and talk
    to?**
     My grandmother from my mom's side.
23. **What's your favorite day?**
     Saturday. You can sleep in and you can stay up late, both without
    affecting your ability to make it to work and/or function.
24. **What's in the trunk of your car?**
     A car vaccuum and a set of jumper cables.
25. **Which do you prefer, sushi or hamburger?**
     Burger. I do like the seaweed and the wasabi paste that go with the
    sushi, but I'm not really a fish eater. Give me a big burger,
    though, and I'm in heaven.
26. **Of the people you e-mailed this to, who's most likely to
    respond?**
     Since I'm not emailing it to anyone, I don't expect anyone to
    really respond at all.
27. **Who's least likely to respond?**
     Well, everyone. Again, since it's not being emailed...
