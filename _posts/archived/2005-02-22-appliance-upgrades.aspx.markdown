I went this weekend and took advantage of some of the President's Day
sales at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com) and bought [a new
dishwasher](http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?prod_id=HD0000001225).
That will be delivered and installed this coming Saturday, and I can
hardly wait. I saw our existing dishwasher in the store - it's the
lowest of the low-end models. No wonder our dishes aren't coming clean.
Once that shows up, I'm going to the store to buy some new glasses -
these are etched from poor drying and have hardened food on the inside
because of poor rinsing.
 
 We are also considering a [new barbecue
grill](http://www.lowes.com/lkn?action=productDetail&productId=160225-451-463453305)
(ours is old and nearly rusted through), an [air hockey
table](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=3311676&cat=78356&type=21&dept=101851&path=0%3A101851%3A115420%3A78356),
and [one of those retractable
awnings](http://www.costco.com/Browse/Productgroup.aspx?prodid=11023463&whse=&topnav=&cat=&s=1)
so we can actually use our back porch.
 
 I'm loving the Roomba - in fact, it's vacuuming right now. Ronco style
- set it and forget it. My mom is skeptical, but I'm happy with it. I
figure I can set it up in a room, push the button, and go do stuff. It
might take three or four times longer than a human to vacuum, but look
at it this way - you're not doing it. Who cares how long it takes? Now
they need one of those that mows your lawn and I'm set.
 
 The TV repair people [haven't called me to schedule the pickup of my TV
for repair](/archive/2005/02/15/new-tube-required.aspx) yet, and that
worries me. I mean, the TV is mostly watchable - it's not just dead
sitting there - but I'd like to get this resolved ASAP. The stress of
the thing is killing me.
