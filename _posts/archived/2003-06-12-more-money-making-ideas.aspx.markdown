People seem to be pretty wowed and disgusted at the whole [poop
knife](/archive/2003/06/09/mysterious-silverware.aspx) thing. But if
it's as common as all that, then maybe there's a market for them. I
mean, you go to the local supermarket, hit the housewares section, and
pick yourself up a PoopKnife<sup>TM</sup> or three. Give them as gifts! Be the
hit of the next bridal shower you go to.
 
 Speaking of showers...
 
 Jenn went to a baby shower this weekend, and since she's broke, guess
who got to buy the gift.
 
 This got me to thinking, and what I've arrived at is this:
 
 *Anything called a shower that doesn't involve bathing is a **scam**.*
 
 I mean, think about it. Starting with marriage, you've got your bridal
shower, where you get the bride a gift. Then you've got the wedding
proper, where you get... another gift. After that you've got your
housewarming, where it requires the purchase of more gifts, then the
baby shower (sometimes both pre-and-post-birth) - more gifts - and
finally the baby gets born and you're supposed to get *more goddamn
gifts*.
 
 Look at that! And I'm sure I'm missing some sort of fucking shower of
some nature in there, but if you tally it up, that's a few more
gift-requiring opportunities than is really necessary.
 
 I think maybe I should have a shower the next time I buy any home
electronics. Like have a Playstation 3 shower (when that comes out).
Then people can come over and bring me gifts that I can use with my
Playstation 3. And it won't even have to be my birthday! I almost wish
I'd thought of this earlier, I'd have had a Game Boy Advance shower, and
maybe a Brand New DVD Player shower, too.
 
 Here's how it works in Travis World: You get married, you get a gift.
You have a baby, *maybe* you get a gift. It's your birthday? Here's a
gift. Christmas? Gift-o-rama. But that's pretty much it. I'm all over
the Spirit of Giving, and sure, sometimes there will be a fun little
gift for no reason. But these planned scam attempts at gift retrieval
known as "showers" are not on the "accepted reasons for getting gifts"
list.
 
 Anyone else having a shower is just getting a PoopKnife<sup>TM</sup>.
