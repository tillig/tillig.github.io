I went last night to see a house that looked reasonable from the
pictures and had decent stats on paper. Jenn called me on my way there
and said she got out of work early so she'd be able to make it, too,
which is not something I expected.
 
 We (Jenn, myself, and the realtor) all got to the house at the same
time, about 5:30p.
 
 Magnificence.
 
 For the price, you can't beat it. Great neighborhood, beautiful yard
(not too big, not too small, well cared for), central heat/air
conditioning, four bedrooms and a bonus room, 2340 square feet... just
awesome. And seeing as how it was only on the market for a day, we
figured it was a pretty safe bet no one had beaten us to it.
 
 We went back to the realtor's office and called the seller's realtor.
Found out an offer had been placed on the house at 4:00p that day (so we
only missed it by a couple of *hours*) but the seller's realtor hadn't
looked at that offer yet and would consider our offer simultaneously
with the offer that had just come in.
 
 We crafted up an offer, tried to make it look appealing (not so
appealing that I'm wasting money or anything, but enough that it will
hopefully look better than the first offer), and now...
 
 ... we wait.
 
 We put an expiration time on the offer of 3:00p today. That gives them
three hours to debate amongst themselves on the offer but not leave us
hanging. So I should know something by this afternoon.
 
 I woke up this morning at 4:30a and couldn't go back to sleep. I'm too
anxious. I'm hoping I can retain a reasonable amount of concentration
today.
