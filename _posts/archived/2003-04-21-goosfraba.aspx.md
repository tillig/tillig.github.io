I'm back, and I'm busier than ever. I've got lots to talk about - this
weekend... LAST weekend... last WEEK... I've even got all of these
little email reminders I sent to myself with prompts for stuff to write
about and a bunch of notes that I wrote during the week so I'd
remember...

 But I don't have time right now. I've got a bunch of troubleshooting
crap that I'm working on involving a Windows XP upgrade that broke some
stuff on my primary workstation as well as a SharePoint Portal Server v2
beta installation that I need to work on. When I get a spare minute,
I'll see what I can jimmy up for ya.

 Oh, and today's my dad's birthday. I best go shopping, huh?
