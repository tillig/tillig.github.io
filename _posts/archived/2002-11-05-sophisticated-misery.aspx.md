Last night I got my copy of the [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*
soundtrack boxed
set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006SM6Q/mhsvortex). Seven
discs of some of the best 80's music out there. Why the actual 80's
radio stations don't play this sort of thing is beyond me. It's hard to
put a label on something and say something like "this is the definitive
80's collection." That's a bold statement. So, instead, I'll say that
this is *damn close* to the definitive 80's collection.

 I noticed on Amazon they don't list the songs that are on each disc, so
I'll do that here. Again, it's a seven disc set - each disc represents a
radio station that you can listen to in the game. So beyond the songs
that are on the discs, they also put parody commercials and fake station
ID jingles. They do not overlap any of the songs; the songs exist on the
discs in their entirety and aren't mixed together the way radio stations
do. So it's the best of all worlds. Anyway, here you go:

- [Disc 1:

Okay, I'll admit that I don't know too many on discs 5 and 7, but hey -
for $50, that's seven discs of some of the best 80's out there. Plus,
each disc allows you to go online and get a cheat code for the game.
Hey, everybody wins.

 On a sort of related note, I got contacted by Amazon customer service
via email and they said everything was on track to ship me [the
game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000696CZ/mhsvortex) and
get it to me by the 7th. Here's hoping. I'd like to schedule my week
off. My cat desperately needs the declawing.
