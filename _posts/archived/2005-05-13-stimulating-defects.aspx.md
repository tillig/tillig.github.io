I'm working on resolving defects for the current project I'm on. One of
the defects is that, intermittently after a reboot, a particular machine
configuration can display something a little odd under certain
circumstances.

 Gotta reproduce, so that means reboot, reboot, reboot...

 I got a puzzle called "Masterball" from my aunt like a month ago. (This
will all tie in, just wait.) It's sort of like Rubik's Cube, but a
sphere instead of a cube. I mixed it up and have been messing with it on
and off ever since.

 The defect resolution:
> Both rebooted and logged in/out several times in succession. Solved
> "Masterball," a puzzle similar to Rubik's Cube, while doing that many
> reboots, but was unable to reproduce the noted defect.

 Very, very stimulating stuff.
