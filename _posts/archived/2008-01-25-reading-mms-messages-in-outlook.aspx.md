I just recently stepped into the now and got a phone with a camera on
it. I'm not really a big cell phone user for the media capabilities, but
every once in a while I've felt that a camera would have been nice.
("Hey, honey, which of these two things do you want at the store?"
\*snap\* \*snap\* send...)

I also do a lot of mailing to myself - [reminder notes and
such](/archive/2007/07/10/convert-an-outlook-message-into-a-task.aspx) -
and all of my stuff is organized in Outlook. When I got my camera phone,
I immediately took a picture and sent it to myself. But I noticed that
Outlook displays the message like this:

![Each piece of the MMS message is an
attachment.]({{ site.url }}/images/20080125mmsdisplay1.png)

Each piece of the MMS message appears as an attachment. (I tried sending
a mixed text/picture message and got two attachments - one for the
image, one for the text.) The trick, then, is to know what type of file
each attachment piece is. Here are a couple of basic tips for viewing
each piece:

- If it's smaller than 1KB, it's probably text. Try opening the file
    in Notepad or some other text editor. If it looks garbled, well,
    it's not text. Just don't save it and you'll be OK.
- If it's larger than 1KB or doesn't display right in Notepad, open
    the file in your favorite image editor. You can even use MS Paint -
    open the editor and drag the attachment in there. You can then save
    it as a particular file type.

The trick really is in guessing the content based on file size.

I looked around for MMS message reading plugins for Outlook but really
didn't find anything. There seems to be a lot out there for sending
these messages, but nothing much on receiving or reading them. If you
have a way to get Outlook to do this automatically, please leave it in
the comments - I'd love to check it out.
