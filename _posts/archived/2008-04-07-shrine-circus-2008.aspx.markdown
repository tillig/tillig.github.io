we went to the [Shrine Circus](http://www.alkadershriners.org/circus/)
and saw [Circus Gatti](http://www.circusgatti.net/) perform. It was very
interesting and brought back some childhood memories as I watched some
kids getting an elephant ride. (I didn't think they did that anymore.)

There were someÂ neat acts and I particularly enjoyed the "[Extreme Metal
Riders](http://www.xmetalriders.com)," a group of guys who ride
motorcycles around in a metal ball. I'd seen three motorcycles at the
same time, but these guys do five and six at once.

The thing I thought was most interesting was truly how small the
production was. They had several acts, but there were only like 20
people in the circus. You'd see one of the acrobats was also one of the
guys riding motorcycles and he was also the juggler. The lady doing an
act with a bunch of hula hoops is also the one who does an act on
gymnastics rings and was a "cheerleader" for the motorcycle guys.

I had to show some respect for them, out there making their way doing
things I know I can't do, but at the same time, [having just seen
Cirque](/archive/2008/03/17/corteo.aspx), it felt so small and... well,
cheap. I feel bad saying that, because you could tell these folks were
doing the best they could with what they had, and if you throw Cirque
sort of money at something, of course it's going to be
bigger-better-faster-stronger. Ticket prices reflected that - Shrine
Circus ticket: $9; Cirque ticket: $85. You do the math. It was a good
time all the same and fun was had by all.

Plus, I had no idea the Shriners had a giant fez mascot. That thing is
the bomb.
