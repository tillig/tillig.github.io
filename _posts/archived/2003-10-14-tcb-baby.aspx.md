That's me - takin' care of business.

 Last night I worked for an hour or two on my Halloween costume and got
it quite a bit further along. Hopefully I'll be able to nearly finish
tonight. There are a couple of alterations I want to make to the pattern
(like putting in buttons or snaps instead of velcro for closure) which I
have to figure out when I get it closer to complete. But that makes me
happy - getting something done there.

 I also watched the 1969 version of [*The Italian
Job*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AUHPB/mhsvortex),
which was pretty good. I had never seen it before, and now some of the
choices they make in [the recent
incarnation](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B1OFL/mhsvortex)
make more sense. There are lots of behind the scenes things on that disc
I need to check out.

 I ordered a new computer today. P4 2.66GHz, 40GB HDD, 1GB RAM, [nVidia
GeForce4 MX 440 video card](http://www.nvidia.com/page/geforce4mx.html),
DVD-ROM, Windows XP Pro, [IBM ThinkCentre
M50](http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=8600572&storeId=1&langId=-1&categoryId=2580518&dualCurrId=73&catalogId=-840).
All for $971, plus $10 shipping, which I can't complain too much
about. I've been meaning to upgrade for quite some time now, so I seized
the opportunity. That should be here in a couple of weeks.

 I worked some more on my new pMachine blog and I think it's just about
ready for prime-time. I hate putting things out there that are "almost
done," but I think it's just about time to move on from GreyMatter and
upgrade to a more complete blogging system. Better for you guys, too.
I'm going to have to import all of my entries from GreyMatter to
pMachine, which is going to be a bitch, but we'll get there. Maybe this
weekend if I take the time.

 Or maybe I'll be playing [*Time Crisis
2*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NUIW/mhsvortex)
instead.
