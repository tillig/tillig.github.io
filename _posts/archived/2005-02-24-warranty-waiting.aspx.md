I got impatient because the TV repair folks haven't called me to
schedule the pickup of my TV for tube replacement so I called them
yesterday. Turns out the warranty company is sitting on it. Apparently
they take three to five business days to approve standard changes; a
tube replacement can take up to ten business days. That would mean I
wouldn't even get the pickup scheduled until *next Thursday*.

 As far as I'm concerned, that's unacceptable. I've been hosed for a
month now, and I'd like it fixed.

 Here's hoping they can come through a little faster than that. Maybe I
can make some more phone calls and get things rolling.
