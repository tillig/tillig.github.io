It seems that [Fred Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com/) has finally
started carrying [Senseo](http://www.senseo.com/) coffee pods (which,
apparently, are coffee *pads* in other countries, but the US somehow got
different terminology), which I am happy about. Now I won't have to
[make my own](http://www.epinions.com/content_3875643524), which looks
like a tough prospect at best, nor will I have to drive to hell and back
to stock up.
