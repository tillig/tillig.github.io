On my way to work today, I was passed by a [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com)
truck that was moving like something on the
[Autobahn](http://www.autobahn-online.de/index_e.html). The guy was
weaving in and out of rush hour traffic like an expert race car driver
and passed by like the rest of traffic was standing still.

 I was *utterly impressed*. It makes me want to ship something FedEx.
For what it's worth, the guy was driving an Overnight Delivery truck. I
kind of wonder if he personally drove the packages across the country
for their next day deliveries. At a speed like that, I could believe
it.

 (All you people wondering how Santa can deliver billions of presents in
one night - he gets that FedEx guy to drive.)

 I've got a very slight cold and went to bed last night after a healthy
dose of DayQuil (we didn't have any NyQuil). I slept better last night
than I've slept in, like, a month. Love it.

 Of course, I'm dead tired this morning.

 I went and traded in my previously viewed copy of [*Bad Boys
II*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DKDUR/mhsvortex) at the
[Hollywood Video](http://www.hollywoodvideo.com/) store I bought it at a
couple of days ago because [DVD X
Rescue](http://www.dvdxcopy.com/DVDXrescue.asp) couldn't make heads or
tails of it. I'm running a test on the new copy I got now - it's already
gotten farther than the last copy.

 Can anyone tell me why ginger ale is always so expensive at the store?
Every other 2-liter product on the market can be on sale for $1, but
the ginger ale is always like $2.50. Why is that? Is the demand so high
that it never needs to go on sale? Bah.
