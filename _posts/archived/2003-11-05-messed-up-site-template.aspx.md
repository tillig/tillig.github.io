I was just looking at [this guy's blog](http://kidliam.blogspot.com/)
when I noticed something happening, and it was so subtle at first that
it sort of took me by surprise.

 As you sit there reading it, the entire site changes its colors.
Slowly, but constantly. Watch for it. It's pretty messed up.
