This week I'm bringing you an *extra-special* Traffic Asshole.

 I went to visit one of my potential mortgage brokers on Friday
afternoon and, seeing as how it was 2:00p, figured I'd head home and
work from there. You know - beat the traffic, so to speak.

 Imagine my surprise to get into *this*:

 *What the hell is going on here?*

 I continued into this quagmire, merging with some other traffic,
equally backed up:

 And when I finally got to the head of this thing, what was it? A wreck?
A death?

 No, *something much more insidious still*:

 *A metered on-ramp.*

 What a load of shit, man. Whoever figured out this metered on-ramp
thing should be fucking *shot*. What else could cause such traffic
devastation in the afternoon?

 I sure as hell won't miss that once I've moved closer to work.
