We went out last night to see
*[Transformers](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/)* for my birthday.
I had heard from some friends that they liked it, so I went in sort of
interested and came out feeling like this was the coolest thing *ever*.

The idea is that the Transformers are robots from another planet that
have come to Earth in search of an energy cube called the All Spark that
gives them life.  If the evil Decepticons get ahold of it before the
friendly Autobots do, the world's in serious trouble.

Yeah, it sounds sort of lame.  But it really wasn't.  For people even
mildly interested in sci fi robot movies, I really don't think you'll be
disappointed.  There was all of the robot battling and transforming you
would expect to see - it was an effects extravaganza.  Lots of action,
as expected from [Michael Bay](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000881/), and
at no time did I feel like I was bored or losing interest.

For fans of the cartoons it's even better.  They got [Peter
Cullen](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0191520/), the original voice of
Optimus Prime, to do the voice in the movie and it's definitely
something you notice.  When he whips out the "Autobots! Roll out!" you
get the shivers of positive childhood memories.  They throw in a couple
of references to "More Than Meets The Eye," too, which is cool.  (When
they say it, listen to the theater crowd.  The people who snicker are
the kids who grew up in the 80's.)  And if you paid close attention to
the names, you'll even notice that [the original
show](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0086817/) had characters with the last
name "Witwicky" (the main character in this movie was "Sam Witwicky,"
played by [Shia LaBeouf](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0479471/)).

The human actors (funny that I have to qualify that...) are also pretty
good.  [Shia LaBeouf](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0479471/) is a great
high school nerd character and [Megan
Fox](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm1083271/) plays a popular high school
girl character.  Both are very entertaining to watch.  [Josh
Duhamel](http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0241049/) plays an Air Force captain
and does a great job, too (I've only ever really seen him on *[Las
Vegas](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0364828/)*).  You have to imagine
Duhamel saw the script and didn't even read it before accepting - no
child of the 80's could pass up the chance to be *in a freaking
Transformers movie*.  No way I could.

At the end we clapped, because, you know, the actors can hear you
clapping in the theater.  I think that's actually how you know you liked
the movie - you feel like clapping at the end.  Jenn claims to have been
slightly disappointed because they didn't play the original theme from
the TV show at any point, but besides that, they gave us everything we
wanted.

I definitely got my money's worth and I'm hoping this hits HD DVD sooner
rather than later.  Good times.
