Call me Attilla, for I am the King of the Huns.
 
 Or something like that.
 
 Yeah, I know I'm just sort of spewing out historical mishmash without
regard to what really happened, but let me tell you, when it comes to
[*Dynasty Warriors
3*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RL4E/mhsvortex), I am
one *bad mamma jamma*. Don't mess with me, heathens. I will cut you
down.
 
 And I've only played like three levels in it.
 
 I called [Magnolia Hi-Fi](http://www.magnoliahifi.com/) today and it
seems [my
TV](http://www.sonystyle.com/home/item.jsp?itemid=50911&hierc=9685x9800x9801&catid=)
has been delayed until the end of this month, so I've gotta call back
*again next week* to find out when it gets there.
 
 I was looking at the insurance statement for some allergy doctor
appointments I had last month. All on one day, I have *two* charges for
\$600 each, both marked "Miscellaneous." I'm having a hard time figuring
out what I did that day that could possibly have cost \$1200. I called
the billing department three hours ago and they have yet to call me
back. That figures.
 
 I've known it for a while, but I continue to rediscover that I am in a
much better mood when I have a gob of caffeine in me. I took some
[Excedrin
Migraine](http://www.excedrin.com/8_product_info/8-2a_emlabel.html) this
morning for my headache and I was in a *great* mood by the time I got to
work. Also, if I drink one of those Red Bull or Amp beverages, I'm
lovin' life. Maybe I'm just tired all the time and that stuff wakes me
up enough to have fun.
