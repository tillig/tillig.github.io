I just got this week's [MSD2D
SharePoint](http://msd2d.com/default_section.aspx?section=sharepoint)
newsletter and I'm the [Tip Of The
Week](http://msd2d.com/newsletter_tip.aspx?section=Sharepoint&id=7d72ff89-efa8-4547-b081-74a551b91d56)!
(At the time I'm writing this, they haven't updated the MSD2D SharePoint
home page to reflect that; it's still last week's tip.)
