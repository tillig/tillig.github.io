It turns out that my cousin has had a lump the size of a walnut sitting
on the back of her knee for the past two years but was afraid to get it
checked... and now it's the size of a tennis ball and wrapped around her
vascular system. She went in and got the official word - it's cancer.
She'll be starting chemotherapy on Tuesday. Unfortunately, due to the
way it's wrapped around in there, they can't operate on it. If the chemo
doesn't work, she may lose her leg.

 The day just gets better and better.
