Hey, gang.

 Due to lack of popular demand, I've opened up the [paraesthesia Junk
Store](http://www.cafepress.com/paraesthesia). Right now, I'm selling
one - count 'em - one t-shirt style. Hey, it's my first foray into
t-shirt design. Anyway, I've got this thing set up so I can now create
new t-shirt styles and everyone who gives a rat's ass can wear
paraesthesia.

 The existing shirt style is, shall we say, a little "less than
exciting." I'll work on some new ones and see what I can put out there.
Honestly, it's mostly for myself - this is the best/only way I know to
make up my own custom shirts and crap. But I figured, might as well open
it up to the rest of the world too. You guys might want some, *right?*
