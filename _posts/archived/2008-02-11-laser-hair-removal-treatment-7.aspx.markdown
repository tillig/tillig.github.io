Saturday was my seventh in a
[series](/archive/2008/01/14/laser-hair-removal-treatment-6.aspx) of
laser hair removal treatments for my face. I had some excellent results
from last time and my facial hair is getting pretty noticeably patchy.
Especially at the end of the day, I get sort of "five o'clock
dirty-face" now since it's less "shadow" and more sparse. (I went to the
dermatologist the other day and forgot to mention I was getting the
treatments. He was all, "I don't remember you mentioning you had really
bad acne when you were younger..." It's pretty patchy.)

The area around my mouth is being a little stubborn, but my chin is the
thickest/coarsest hair on my face, so that's to be expected, and we
hadn't done the MedioStar laser around my lips because that's apparently
the most painful area. To remedy some of that, this time we did
MedioStar around the lips (not actually any more or less painful than
anywhere else) and went over my chin twice. We also did full face with
the DermoFlash IPL. We should be getting some great results this time,
though my face burned for a day like a bad sunburn and it hurts to shave
because it's very tender. My patchiness is also far more visible this
morning because I have a small amount of bruising, which is not uncommon
and generally goes away in four or five days.

Treatment is getting noticeably less painful every time. I'm pretty sure
that doing the DermoFlash for a few treatments was the right way to go
(for me) because it thinned things out enough that the MedioStar became
bearable. They also fairly recently got this cold air machine that blows
supercooled air and freezes you right up, making things, again, more
bearable. It beats the crap out of putting ice on your face, [which
doesn't work](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx).
