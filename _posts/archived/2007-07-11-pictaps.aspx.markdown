Found [this nifty little thing](http://roxik.com/pictaps/) via [Penny
Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com).  It's a site where you draw a 2D
character and they make it dance around in 3D using Flash.  I threw
together this stick figure one to see how it works.  Sorta neat, and
free.  But, damn, the music is annoying.

Note that I don't think they thought about scalability on the thing and
it's become reasonably popular, so it seems to be hit or miss on whether
the thing actually plays.
