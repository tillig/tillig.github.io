[Cirque du Soleil](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com) is bringing their
[Dralion](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/touring/dralion)
show to Portland and I've got my tickets! Come June 14, I'll be sitting
right up front (three rows back from center stage) taking in some of the
most wonderful entertainment I've ever encountered.
 
 I've seen the
[Mystere](http://www.treasureislandlasvegas.com/pages/myst_main.asp)
show at the [Treasure Island, Las
Vegas](http://www.treasureislandlasvegas.com/) like three times now and
it just gets better every time. I've also seen the
[Saltimbanco](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/shows/touring/saltimbanco)
show, last time it was in Portland. I'm totally excited to see this
latest arrival. When the big top goes up, I'll probably be chomping at
the bit.
