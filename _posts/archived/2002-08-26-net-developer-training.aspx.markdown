It's Friday, August 23, but this probably won't get posted until Monday.
I'm in the second day of .NET developer training, bored as hell,
disconnected from the Internet, and totally unable to blog, so I'll
write this now and post it later.

 I'm working on an art project where I'm separating a Mucha piece into
layers and then I'm going to print it on transparency to give it
dimension. I've been working on it for around three months now, and I've
finally finished cleaning up the scanned image and separating it into
layers. Now I just have to print it out and figure out how to frame it.
I think the hard part is done. (I finished that while sitting here in
training. Took about 10 hours, for a total of around 100 hours of
working on this thing. Not easy, but it looks really good now.)

 I'm noticing there are several classes of people in this training. I'm
not sure which class I fit in, but let's see if you know what I'm
talking about:

-   **The Managers**: The Managers don't know how to code and they'll
    probably never actually do anything in the development environment.
    They'll watch, ask stupid questions, and "assess," but for all
    intents and purposes, they shouldn't be here. Most likely, they're
    just here to see if the developers that work under them are lying
    when they say something is technologically impossible.
-   **The Over-Participants**: An Over-Participant wants so badly to be
    the teacher's pet that they'll ask questions that were just answered
    or just simply restate what was just said by prepending it with "So,
    let me get this straight..." For example, the teacher will say, "If
    you add two and two, you get four." The Over-Participant will then
    raise his/her hand and, when called on, say, "So, let me get this
    straight - if you add two and two, you get four."
-   **The Talkers**: Talkers don't care if you're trying to listen. They
    don't care how loud they are, and they sure as hell don't realize
    their voices are very nasal and carry throughout the room. All they
    care about is the fact that they have something to say during the
    lecture. The Talkers always sit right behind me. I'm not sure why.
    Usually the Talkers are talking to the Over-Participants.
-   **The Dirty Programmers**: I'm talking actually, physically dirty.
    These are the people who program so much that they forget about
    hygiene. Greasy hair, strong body odor, and clothing requiring a
    good laundering are all required. I think my favorite example of
    this from the training is this guy, probably 5' 10", 300 pounds, who
    never combed his hair and wore oil-stained "Big Dog" t-shirts and
    faded cargo pants both days. Yow. Usually poor social skills
    accompany the Dirty Programmer.
-   **The Non-Technical Programmers**: These are the people who are
    hired to program *commercial products* but can't figure out how to
    change their own screen resolution in Windows. You usually see the
    Non-Technical Programmer listening intently to the lecturer and
    nodding at intervals to indicate their apparent understanding of the
    concept being discussed.
-   **The Too-Technical Programmers**: These people already know all
    about what's being lectured on. They're bored, but they do want to
    learn, so they ask questions that go *way* beyond the scope of the
    lecture, stuff the lecturer would have no way of knowing or even
    finding out.

I think I probably fit in the "Too-Technical Programmer" category, if
anywhere, but who knows? I'd like to think I don't fit anywhere, but
there's probably another category... **The Attention-Deficit Attendee**:
This person can't pay attention to the lecture regardless of what they
do because there's not enough going on. Rather than pay attention, they
find *anything* else to do (like write posts for their blog) and listen
through their periphery.

 I am the Attention-Deficit Attendee.

 I've played more Solitaire, Freecell, and Minesweeper than I care to
think about. I've done all I can on my art project. I've even come up
with a logo for a company event we're having soon. *Bored, bored,
bored.*
