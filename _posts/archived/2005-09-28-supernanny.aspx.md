![Supernanny](https://hyqi8g.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y2pJeTOf8Ph8iGWRyld-VAdwUwXyu4XyuWF6Tk5vqA6c6QJsL5MjPwYtUSlrP6eK5V2fUTJdM0qz1iA04EF1n-mVjTBPlu0Kff890P-Mi-fVlk/20050928supernanny.jpg?psid=1)I've
been watching the show [Supernanny](http://www.supernanny.net/) a bit
lately, it being a total train wreck as far as the ridiculous
out-of-control-nature of the kids on the show and whatnot, and over the
course of watching I realized something:
 
 I can't really quantify what it is, but there's something about Jo
Frost that is just *hot*. I'm gonna have to take *that* one to the
psychologist, aren't I? I'm sure Freud would be having a ball with me.
