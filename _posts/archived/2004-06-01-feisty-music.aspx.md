I'm feeling a little feisty today. A cross between restless and
irritated with a hint of hyperactivity. One of those moods where you
need to fidget and can't focus. Big surprise there.

 The weekend: I fixed my toilet Friday... rented a couple of movies
Saturday (nothing to write home about)... played some Prince of Persia
on Sunday... hung out with my parents on Monday... that's about it.

 Listening to the iPod this morning on the way to the eye doctor I
started thinking about all the different songs that have meaning in my
life. Listening to the different stuff on the iPod I can tell you where
I was in my life when a given song came out or a particular event that
happened when that song was playing. It's almost better than a journal;
it's like reliving the past in the present.

 I happened to hear a cut by [Pop Will Eat
Itself](http://pweination.org/) and it reminded me of high school. Mom
got on sort of a "wholesome" kick and decided that PWEI was "devil
music" (yes, the words "devil music" were actually used to describe it)
so she confiscated all of my PWEI tapes and CDs. At the time, it seemed
that use of the word "fuck" in music pretty much qualified it
immediately as "devil music."

 We had a discussion - nay, a heated argument - about what constitutes
"devil music" that went something like this:

 **Mom:** The music you're listening to is devil music!
 **Trav:** What makes it devil music?
 **Mom:** Every generation has its own new music, designed to push
boundaries. This is no different. It's made to corrupt your mind. It's
trash!
 **Trav:** So every generation has devil music.
 **Mom:** Yeah.
 **Trav:** And the new music in each generation is usually it.
 **Mom:** Yeah.
 **Trav:** And the new music in your generation was The Beatles.
 **Mom:** So?
 **Trav:** So by your logic, The Beatles is also devil music.
 **Mom:** Go to your room!

 Yeah, I thought it was crap, too. I mean, if you don't like the
language, I guess that's one thing, but don't accuse me of listening to
devil music unless you have a strong case. Anyway, my PWEI CDs got
confiscated, which was an extraordinary inconvenience because at the
time they had gone out of print. In particular, the [*Cure For
Sanity*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000008JIR/mhsvortex)
disc was hard to find, and that was problematic because that was my
favorite CD of the time. (For the record, she was also pissed off about
my [Nine Inch Nails
CD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000GPY/mhsvortex), but I
don't recall her taking that one.)

 Anyway, it took me a couple of weeks to scour the downtown Portland
area and find a small dance record store who happened to have the last
copy of *Cure For Sanity*. I still have that CD to this day and it's
still one of my favorites. (Mom's probably going to be pissed when she
reads this one, but this was like 13 years ago, and I'm a little older
now, so I'm sure she'll cope. I'm also still a NIN fan, but I think
[*Pretty Hate
Machine*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000GPY/mhsvortex)
was the best album Reznor's put out to date.)

 Ah, memories. I'm sure you all have those music memories. Maybe one of
these days I'll put out a few more of them on the site, so they might
not be forever lost.
