If you use [Typemock
Isolator](http://www.plimus.com/jsp/redirect.jsp?contractId=1655929&referrer=tillig)
and you're an ASP.NET MVC3 user, you probably noticed that some of your
tests have been failing with exceptions like
System.VerificationException.

**The latest version of Isolator, 6.0.8, fixes the issue.** [Head on
over and
update](http://http://www.plimus.com/jsp/redirect.jsp?contractId=1655929&referrer=tillig).
