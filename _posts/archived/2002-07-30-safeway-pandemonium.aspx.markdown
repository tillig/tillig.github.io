I went to [Safeway](http://www.safeway.com/) to stock up my fridge at
work and get some lunch.

 I only go to Safeway, at least on this side of town, once in a blue
moon. How come every time I go there's either construction in the
parking lot or they're remodeling the building?

 Apparently, this time they're putting in a
[Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com). Because there aren't more
Starbucks outlets around here than there are [7-11
stores](http://www.7-11.com/).

 While I was shopping, I realized there's something they don't sell that
they should.

 *How come you can't buy [fried
eggs](http://www.cnn.com/fyi/interactive/news/brain/brain.on.drugs.html)?*

 I mean, in the name of convenience, they have cooked chickens, sliced
cheese, and microwave breakfast sandwiches, but if I wanted to buy a
fried egg, I'm SOL. They could come in round Pringle-style containers.
You could buy them in three varieties - solid yolk, liquid yolk, or (for
the health-conscious) no yolk. They could even have spin-off products:
poached eggs, hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, etc. All you have to do
is put 'em on a plate and nuke 'em for a protein-filled snack.

 I'll have to think about this some more.
