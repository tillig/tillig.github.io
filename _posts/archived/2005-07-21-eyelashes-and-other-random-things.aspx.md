Tuesday and Wednesday I felt like I had something in my eye. I couldn't
see anything when I looked in the mirror, and I tried washing my eye out
but it still was there. Wednesday I decided to take a trip to the eye
doctor.

 I had an eyelash growing inwards. Explains why I never saw anything -
every time I looked for what was in my eye, I would pull back my lid to
get a better view. Feeling much better now, but I'm sure that's going to
cost me.

 Watched that [*So You Think You Can Dance*](http://www.fox.com/dance/)
show last night. Eh. Not awesome, but better than *American Idol*.

 Also fixed our upstairs bathtub faucet. When they installed it, they
had a brake inside the faucet handle set so the maximum water
temperature was limited. Of course, that meant you got the water to
lukewarm and that's about it. I found the [specs
online](http://www.moen.com/shared/pdf/instruction_sheets/INS007E.pdf)
and was able to fix that right up. I'm not sure how people did this
stuff without the Internet.

 Speaking of the Internet, I found a guy who [melted down 13 pounds of
gummy bears into one big
one](http://homepage.mac.com/vasu42/PhotoAlbum5.html). Reminds me of [my
taffy
brick](/archive/2004/12/23/twas-the-day-before-the-night-before-christmas.aspx).

 I also saw that James Doohan (*Star Trek*'s Scotty) [died yesterday at
85](http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/20/obit.doohan.ap/index.html).
That's too bad, and I'm sorry to see him go.

 Finally it's my parents' anniversary today, so happy anniversary to
them.
