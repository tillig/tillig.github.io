My
[CR\_JoinLines](/archive/2005/08/30/cr_joinlines---join-lines-in-visual-studio-code-editor-via.aspx)
and
[CR\_SortLines](/archive/2005/09/06/cr_sortlines---sort-lines-in-visual-studio-code-editor-via.aspx)
plugins for DXCore have been joined up with the [DXCore Community
Plugins project](http://code.google.com/p/dxcorecommunityplugins/)
headed by [Rory Becker](http://rorybecker.blogspot.com). Complete
source, installation/usage info, etc., has all been put up over there
and any further dev on them will be done there.

Hopefully this more public release area will be helpful to folks who not
only want to find andÂ use the plugins, but also who want to learn how to
write plugins.
