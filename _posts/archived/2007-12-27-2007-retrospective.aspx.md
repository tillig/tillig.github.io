Another year come and gone, so it's time again to throw up a bit of a
retrospective of highlights for the past 365. (For reference, [here's
last year's
retrospective](/archive/2007/01/04/2006-retrospective.aspx).)

In January, I put out [version 2.1 of my DHTML tooltips for Amazon
links](/archive/2007/01/05/amazon-associate-dhtml-image-tooltips-2.1-released.aspx)
(which are sort of obsolete now since Amazon has all that set up from
their site in a much richer format). I did [a review of various
clipboard management
software](/archive/2007/01/24/clipboard-manager-software.aspx) and ended
up with [ClipX as the
winner](/archive/2007/01/25/clipboard-follow-up-clipx.aspx) of that
showdown. I also pumped out [a little command-line GUID
generator](/archive/2007/01/24/guidgenconsole-generate-guids-at-the-command-line.aspx) and
[a custom NAnt task
assembly](/archive/2007/01/29/paraesthesia.tools.nanttasks-custom-nant-tasks.aspx)
with some helpful stuff in it.

In February, we got [a new little terrorist cat named
Jack](/archive/2007/02/04/introducing-jack.aspx). I published some [tips
on disaster recovery and trouble-free continuous
integration](/archive/2007/02/07/disaster-recovery-and-trouble-free-continuous-integration.aspx).
We all got [a little sick of hearing about
FizzBuzz](/archive/2007/02/28/sick-of-fizzbuzz.aspx) toward the end of
the month.

March got me [trying to get people to switch their blogs to use inline
styling when including code
snippets](/archive/2007/03/08/switch-to-inline-styles-for-code-formatting.aspx)
because they don't format right in RSS otherwise. I'm still fighting
that one. I got [Media Center working with my Xbox
360](/archive/2007/03/23/media-center-2005-and-xbox-360-success.aspx)
in a test environment (but I'm still trying to determine the right way
to go to serve up DVDs and [meet all of my
requirements](/archive/2007/03/26/my-media-center-goal.aspx)).

In April I had electronics and DRM issues. The lifespan of my 3G iPod
sort of reached a logical limit as [I hit the 1418 error and found that
the iPod must be plugged into the wall while ~~charging~~
synchronizing](/archive/2007/04/03/3g-ipod-borked-by-itunes-7.aspx) as
of iTunes 7. [I got a Red Ring of Death on my second Xbox
360](/archive/2007/04/10/xbox-360-red-ring-of-death.aspx) (which hit me
with [some bad DRM
juju](/archive/2007/04/27/xbox-live-marketplace-still-has-drm-troubles.aspx)) and
[bought a new DVD player because of bad Sony
DRM](/archive/2007/04/16/new-sony-dvds-not-working-in-some-players.aspx).
I also got into the design for testability vs. design for usability
debate [with respect to static helper
utilities](/archive/2007/04/20/design-for-testability-vs.-static-utilities.aspx).
Oh, and I attended MIX07, which I blogged a lot about
[[1](/archive/2007/04/29/mix07-day-0.aspx),
[2](/archive/2007/04/30/mix07-day-1-keynote-ray-ozzie-scott-guthrie-and.aspx),
[3](/archive/2007/04/30/mix07-developing-silverlight-applications-with-javascript.aspx),
[4](/archive/2007/04/30/mix07-developing-ajax-applications-with-visual-studio-orcas.aspx),
[5](/archive/2007/04/30/mix07-ajax-patterns.aspx),
[6](/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-front-ending-the-web-with-microsoft-office.aspx),
[7](/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-designing-for-ajaxria.aspx),
[8](/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-developing-asp.net-ajax-controls-with-silverlight.aspx),
[9](/archive/2007/05/01/mix07-labs-and-day-2-keynotes.aspx),
[10](/archive/2007/05/02/mix07-the-pure-party-and-the-morning-after.aspx)].

May saw [CheckFree acquiring
Corillian](/archive/2007/05/15/im-a-checkfree-associate-now.aspx). It
also saw [TypeMock publishing a nice case study of its usage inside
Corillian](/archive/2007/05/17/typemock-case-study-in-corillian.aspx). I
[tried to figure out how you'd detect through reflection if two object
types can be added
together](/archive/2007/05/24/how-do-you-tell-if-two-objects-can-be-added.aspx),
but never did get an answer. Just at the end of the month, [I posted the
EmbeddedPageHandlerFactory](/archive/2007/05/31/embeddedpagehandlerfactory-binary-only-asp.net-1.1.aspx)

- a way to serve up ASP.NET 1.1 from embedded resources.

In June [*The Sopranos* ended with a
whimper](/archive/2007/06/12/sopranos-what-the-hell-was-that.aspx) and
[I migrated my blog to
Subtext](/archive/2007/06/16/subtext-migration-complete.aspx). I
[preordered
*GTA4*](/archive/2007/06/19/preordered-grand-theft-auto-iv-special-edition.aspx)
(which still hasn't shipped), posted [a CodeSmith template for
generating generic KeyedCollection
derivatives](/archive/2007/06/19/system.collections.objectmodel.keyedcollection-codesmith-template.aspx) and
[solved the Guitar Hero controller loose whammy bar
problem](/archive/2007/06/22/solution-to-the-guitar-hero-loose-whammy-bar-problem.aspx)
with some o-rings.

In July [I did a fireworks show in Walla Walla,
WA](/archive/2007/07/06/walla-walla-fireworks-2007.aspx), gave away some
code to [convert an Outlook message into a
task](/archive/2007/07/10/convert-an-outlook-message-into-a-task.aspx),
and made [a bookmarklet to automatically copy an Amazon Associates URL
to your
clipboard](/archive/2007/07/10/copy-amazon-associates-product-url-bookmarklet.aspx) while
browsing Amazon. [I published the
EmbeddedResourcePathProvider](/archive/2007/07/13/embeddedresourcepathprovider-binary-only-asp.net-2.0.aspx)

- a way to serve up ASP.NET 2.0 from embedded resources. Oh, and [I
turned 31](/archive/2007/07/22/birthday-in-the-lost-room.aspx).

I started August out by showing you [how to mock a page request
lifecycle with
TypeMock](/archive/2007/08/02/mock-a-page-request-lifecycle-with-typemock.aspx).
I started getting [laser hair removal on my
face](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx) (which
I've continued to do:
[1](/archive/2007/08/27/laser-hair-removal-treatment-1.aspx),
[2](/archive/2007/09/25/laser-hair-removal-treatment-2.aspx),
[3](/archive/2007/10/26/laser-hair-removal-treatment-3.aspx),
[4](/archive/2007/12/17/laser-hair-removal-treatment-5.aspx)). I also
posted some [tips for non-programmers who want to learn how to
program](/archive/2007/08/30/tips-for-non-programmers-who-want-to-learn-to-program.aspx).

In September [my Xbox got tanked by a dashboard
update](/archive/2007/09/21/on-to-xbox-360-number-four.aspx) so I got to
send it in for repair, making this the third time I've had to get things
fixed. I found [an odd issue where ISAPI filters were causing problems
with
.NET](/archive/2007/09/25/app-domain-could-not-be-created-check-your-isapi-filters.aspx) and
showed you how to [optimize your TortoiseSVN cache for better disk
I/O](/archive/2007/09/26/optimize-tortoise-svn-cache-tsvncache.exe-disk-io.aspx).

In October I celebrated [my first wedding
anniversary](/archive/2007/10/15/first-anniversary.aspx). I ran into a
problem where I found that [.NET assemblies store enum values, not
references to the original
enum](/archive/2007/10/18/the-old-enum-switcharoo.aspx), which caused
some havoc. I got hit by [some changes in the Xbox Live DRM
model](/archive/2007/10/27/changes-in-xbox-live-drm.aspx), which, two
months later, I'm still fighting. I also posted a program to help you
[copy iTunes track metadata from one track to
another](/archive/2007/10/29/copytrackmetadata-copy-itunes-track-info.aspx).

In November I went to the Microsoft Patterns and Practices Summit (Days
[1](/archive/2007/11/06/microsoft-patterns-practices-summit-2007-day-1.aspx),
[2](/archive/2007/11/06/microsoft-patterns-practices-summit-2007-day-2.aspx),
[3](/archive/2007/11/07/microsoft-patterns-practices-summit-2007-day-3.aspx),
[4](/archive/2007/11/09/microsoft-patterns-practices-summit-2007-day-4.aspx),
[5](/archive/2007/11/09/microsoft-patterns-practices-summit-2007-day-5.aspx))
and [met Lutz Roeder](/archive/2007/11/09/pp-nerd-dinner.aspx) while up
there. I posted some [tips on writing good XML doc comments in your
code](/archive/2007/11/14/on-writing-good-xml-documentation-comments.aspx).
I [participated in the One Laptop Per Child
program](/archive/2007/11/14/bought-my-xo-laptop.aspx) (which I later
[unboxed for you](/archive/2007/12/20/xo-laptop-unbox.aspx)). I
installed VS 2008 and [the install was the
worst](/archive/2007/11/20/vs-2008-now-my-worst-install-experience-evar.aspx).
I [rounded up some "Command Prompt Here"
utilities](/archive/2007/11/20/command-prompt-here-round-up.aspx) for
you and learned, via *Rock Band*, that [I might just suck as a
drummer](/archive/2007/11/25/i-might-just-suck-as-a-drummer.aspx).
Finally, I showed you [how to use ParseControl to combine ASP.NET skins
and localization
effectively](/archive/2007/11/29/combining-skins-and-localized-strings-in-asp.net.aspx).

December saw [CheckFree getting acquired by
Fiserv](/archive/2007/12/04/checkfree-now-part-of-fiserv.aspx). [Xbox
DRM continues to eat my
lunch](/archive/2007/12/10/xbox-live-drm-eating-my-lunch.aspx) so I
posted [some maintenance
secrets](/archive/2007/12/10/xbox-360-maintenance-secrets.aspx) that
might help you avoid a call to Xbox Support. I posted
[UrlAbsolutifierModule](/archive/2007/12/14/urlabsolutifiermodule-convert-urls-in-asp.net-output-to-absolute.aspx)

- an HttpModule that helps you convert URLs from relative to absolute
format in ASP.NET. I watched [the sixth season of *24* all in one
day](/archive/2007/12/17/24-season-6.aspx), found that [FxCop 1.35 uses
Office 2003 for its spell
checker](/archive/2007/12/19/fxcop-1.35-spell-checking-uses-office-2003.aspx),
and showed you [how to move your iTunes music
library](/archive/2007/12/24/moving-your-itunes-library.aspx).

That pretty much brings us to current. It's been a heck of a year - I
got acquired twice, went to some great conferences (and met some cool
people), and posted some [hopefully helpful] stuff for folks. Here's to
a great upcoming 2008!
