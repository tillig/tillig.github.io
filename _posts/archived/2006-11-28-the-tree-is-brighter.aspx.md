I got home yesterday and Jenn decided we should go cold turkey and get
all new ornaments for the tree, once again proving I made the right
decision on [October 14](/archive/2006/10/27/the-royal-wedding.aspx).

 We stopped in at Starbucks for a peppermint mocha Frappuccino and
continued on to Target where we loaded up with various sizes of gold and
red balls as well as a few accent ornaments we thought were really cool.
Brought all that back home, un-decorated the tree, packed up the old
ornaments, and decorated the tree with our all-new fixings during the
commercials while watching [*Heroes*](http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/).

 It looks pretty cool, if I do say so myself. I'm really curious how the
tree skirt will look when we get it done, but it's mostly black and gold
with a little cream in it, so it should be OK. The tree topper is still
the one that came with the tree, but it's not horrible and we ran out of
Target gift cards getting the ornaments anyway.

 So I don't [hate the
tree](/archive/2006/11/27/not-a-thanksgiving-fan.aspx) anymore. Next
step - finishing the tree skirt!
