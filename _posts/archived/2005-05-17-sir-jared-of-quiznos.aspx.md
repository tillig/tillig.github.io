I think my new favorite restaurant is
[Quizno's](http://www.quiznos.com/). I'm not even really a "sandwich
guy," but I never really get tired of eating at Quizno's. I went there
for lunch today, and if Jenn told me we were having it for dinner
tonight, I'd be cool with that.

 It's actually been kind of a staple in the new diet that Jenn and I
have been on for a couple of months. I think we eat at Quizno's once or
twice a week at least. And I'm doing well - I checked last night and I'm
down like 10 pounds in the last month. I'm going to be, like, the
[Jared](http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/healthliving/health.aspx)
of Quizno's. They should just give me my sandwiches for free and in
return I'll pimp their stuff.
