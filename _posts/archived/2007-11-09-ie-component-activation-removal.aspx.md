I hate that stupid thing where a Flash or Silverlight object isn't
"active" in IE until you click on it.  Annoying as hell.  Looks like I'm
not the only one who thought so - [they're removing it in April
2008](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/11/08/ie-automatic-component-activation-changes-to-ie-activex-update.aspx).
I can *hardly freaking wait*.
