![Where are the stir stick QA
people?]({{ site.url }}/images/20030516stirsticks.jpg)Not
that this is a huge deal or anything, but I was noticing that the little
plastic stir sticks in the coffee area at work are all different
lengths. I mean, where's the QA department on this one? You'd think that
manufacturing identical plastic straws wouldn't be that hard, but
apparently getting a consistent length is a difficult task.

 Since I [last whined](/archive/2003/05/12/paring-down.aspx) I've had a
phone conversation with my father that turned unproductive very quickly
which boiled down to this:

 **Dad:** I don't understand why you blew up when I asked you to pick up
your stuff.

 **Travis:** Because you tell me to pick up my stuff nearly every time I
see you. Seriously. You've said that you're moving for probably the last
three years, but nothing ever happens and, frankly, I don't have the
room to put this stuff. So if you're not moving, don't keep harping
about it.

 **Dad:** You were very sarcastic and negative about it.

 **Travis:** You're very critical.

 **Dad:** No, I'm not.

 **Travis:** If your body was possessed by aliens and I told you that
you were body snatched, you would tell me that you weren't because
you're right in the middle of it and wouldn't know. Trust me, you're
critical.

 **Dad:** Maybe so. You're negative.

 **Travis:** More than you know. But the long and the short of it is -
if you don't want my opinion, don't ask for it.

 **Dad:** You don't have to come get your stuff.

 **Travis:** [Frustrated] Then why did you say I did?

 **Dad:** I gotta go.

 **Travis:** Whatever.

 And that was that. Granted, the conversation was more like 15 minutes
long and there was a lot of arguing in circles, but I think everyone
understands everyone else now.

 As for them moving, I will continue to maintain my "I'll believe it
when I see it" status. Even though Dad feels that's a negative and
sarcastic attitude.

 Oh, and you ever notice that when you argue with someone, they only
ever take into account the fact that you've potentially hurt other
peoples' feelings, but they never consider that they hurt you first?

 My upcoming training schedule has been jerked around on me due to some
unexpected class cancellations so now instead of taking all of my
courses locally, I'm going to be heading to Bellevue, WA, twice in the
next month or two to take a couple of the courses up there (since
they're not offered here). Bah. Not that I don't want to learn, but
Bellevue's four hours away and there's not a lot to do there. At least,
not that I saw.

 I should get to work. I have way too much to do and totally not enough
time. People say that cloning humans is a bad idea, but I'm thinking
that if I could have two of me, that's twice as much stuff I could get
done in a reliable, well-documented fashion.
