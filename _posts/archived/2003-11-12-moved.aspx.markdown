I'm going to call this the official move announcement for paraesthesia.
I'm running pMachine as my blog now, and will no longer be maintaining
the Greymatter blog I was using. If you've found me and you're reading
this message, *this is the place*. Welcome. I'll be continuing to tweak
the template and fix things as I find them, but it's functional and I
need to get things moving on this.
 
 You'll notice I now have an RSS feed that you can subscribe to, and if
you register as a user you can also be notified of things as they happen
(like the paraesthesia mailing list, right?). Plus, if you want to leave
a comment and you've logged in, you won't have to type in all of your
vitals - it'll just know you.
 
 And who knows? Maybe soon I'll have some "members only" stuff (not like
the jackets, more like stuff that only members can get to). I suppose it
depends on how many folks I can get to register. We'll see.
 
 In the meantime, like I said, I'll keep working on this thing and we'll
see if we can get something good done. I know there's some work I need
to do on the administrative interface to get the macro keys to work
closer to Greymatter (I had that totally customized, man, and now...
primitive).
