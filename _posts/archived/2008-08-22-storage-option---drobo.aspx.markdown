A potential storage alternative to Windows Home Server for my media
center: [Drobo](http://www.drobo.com). Looks like a cool, affordable
device that has the ability to make several disks appear as one (which
is the feature I was really looking for in WHS). They even have [an
add-on](http://www.drobo.com/Products/droboshare.html) that can turn the
whole thing into NAS. Slick.

**UPDATE 8/25/08**: I ended up [getting a Windows Home
Server](/archive/2008/08/25/windows-home-server-first-impressions.aspx).
