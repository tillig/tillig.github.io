![Xbox 360 General Hardware
Failure](https://hyqi8g.dm2302.livefilestore.com/y2pycgazfc2MAFw1JpXCAHm-zN6acIZ3sJcuSMX6-sQX4G5k2ImHEIxZ0DGoTmNd3YlPywEjknDHTCRHNclFIcv8ixhZ7Nut5dwf_j6F6qPw6s/20070410ringofdeath.jpg?psid=1)Sonofa*bitch*.
 
 There I was, playing a little *Marvel: Ultimate Alliance*, when the
Xbox locked up on me while loading the next level. It's happened before,
so I turned the Xbox off (the control was unresponsive after several
minutes) and turned it back on again.
 
 And I saw the [Red Ring of
Death](http://editorials.teamxbox.com/xbox/1651/The-Red-Ring-of-Death/p1/).
 
 Apparently this is common enough to have [a knowledge base article all
to itself](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907534).
 
 This is actually [the second Xbox 360 I'll have
had](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2006/07/24/caketastic-30th.aspx) -
my last one failed on my birthday last July. Different failure, but both
times I've had to send it back to be fixed. Hopefully I won't have to go
through [the DRM hoops I had to go through last
time](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2006/08/10/xbox-live-arcade-got-drm-all-wrong.aspx)
to get my Xbox Live Arcade games to work on whatever console comes back
to me.
