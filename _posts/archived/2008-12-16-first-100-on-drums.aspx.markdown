I blogged a while ago (in [my drum comparison
entry](/archive/2008/11/07/drum-comparison-ion-vs.-rock-band-vs.-guitar-hero-world.aspx))
that I'd never gotten 100% on a song playing the drums in *Rock Band*,
even on easy difficulty, and I generally play on medium or hard. It was
like my own personal [Curse of the
Bambino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Bambino) going on -
no matter what I did, I'd always miss one note. Maybe it was a stupid
mistake on my part, maybe it was a double-hit registered, but whatever
the reason, never did I get 100%.

**The curse has been broken!**

Last night I got 100% on the No Doubt song "Hella Good" on medium
difficulty. Interestingly enough, I actually got two 100% songs last
night - the other was "My Best Friend's Girl" by The Cars. The hardest
songs in the world? Not by a long shot, but I'm still pretty proud. I'm
not afraid to admit I was singing songs about how I'm the King of Drums
last night. No, I'm not an awesome drummer, but I was pretty stoked with
myself.

And, yes, you'll see my character's name is "Alyss." All of my
characters are named based on Frank Beddor's *[Looking Glass

characters. My guitarist is Hatter Madigan, my band is Wonderland's
Millinery... you get the idea. Here's Alyss:
