[Typemock Isolator 5.0 has been
released](http://blog.typemock.com/2008/08/typemock-isolator-50-released.html)
and there are a lot of cool things that come with it. The two big ones:

- **Arrange/Act/Assert syntax**: A more fluent syntax style for
    setting up your mocks. [You can still use the old
    API](http://blog.typemock.com/2008/07/do-i-need-to-rewrite-my-tests-for-new.html),
    but the new one offers a nice alternative to the classic
    record/playback metaphor.
- **Open Source licensing**: [I blogged about
    this](/archive/2008/07/24/typemock-isolator-open-source-licenses.aspx)
    before, but it's finally [in
    effect](http://www.typemock.com/licenseinformation.php). You can get
    the goodness of Isolator for use in your open source project. I'll
    totally be hooking this up in
    [CR_Documentor](http://code.google.com/p/cr-documentor/).

This is huge. I'm totally excited. [Check it
