I saw the movie [*Panic Room*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0258000) this
weekend. For those interested, it was actually well worth checking out.
It wasn't scary *at all*, but there was some good suspense going.
[Forest Whitaker](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Whitaker,+Forest) (who is very
cool) was good in it, but let me tell you now, and have no illusions
about it:

 *It was **all** about the [Jodie
Foster](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Foster,+Jodie) cleave shots.*

 There was some pretty damn good JF cleavage going on in this one. As
far as I'm concerned, worth the price of admission. Gay, straight, bi,
whatever. She's hot. That's all there is to it.

 Oh, and her daughter (in the movie) was *annoying as hell*. If my kids
ever act like that, I'll beat the crap out of them. I mean, come on -
you don't ride your stupid scooter through a house you're walking
through to buy. Seriously.

 The [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) won game six of the
seven game series with Seattle, so I guess I'll be at game seven
tomorrow. Admittedly, I sort of hoped they'd lose because I'd like a
little more time to not have to run around all the time, but since they
won, I hope they make it all the way.

 Of course, if we have to play Spokane, it's all over.

 Had a good Easter dinner at Mom and Dad's place. Afterwards, Jenn and I
got tormented with home movies that my parents had filmed but never
watched. Actually, it wasn't that bad - we have my cousin dancing at
Christmas from a couple of years ago, drunk and doing his best attempt
at breakdancing. I really should digitize that and put it up here. It's
just way too funny.

 On a whole other topic...

 We have [air
pots](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S56Q/mhsvortex) full
of coffee here at work. There are three pots, all of which should have
some level of coffee in them at all times. There are *three* huge signs
around the pots, all of which say (in some form or another), "If you
take the last cup, make a new pot." It takes, seriously, about two
minutes to grind the beans and start a new pot of coffee.

 I went to get a cup a little bit ago and there wasn't a drop of coffee
in *any of the pots*. Not one. I don't think I could have combined the
dregs from the pots to make half a cup. I thought about starting a new
pot, but then decided that if I didn't *get* any, I wasn't gonna *make*
any. Fair's fair.

 I think I need to start a CoffeeCam. Stick a motion-sensitive camera
out there, aimed at the pots (and, more importantly, the people getting
coffee). Let's see who the last person was so we can stick it to them.
Or, even better, rig the stand the pots sit on with scales so you only
take pictures of the people who leave the pots with less than a cup of
coffee in them. I don't think that'd be too difficult. Maybe I should
start that as a side project.
