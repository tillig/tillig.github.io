Got the cable phone hooked up on Saturday. Decided that we were tired of
shelling out to Verizon for what has thus been sub-par service and that
we'd go with the ol' Comcast phone because we've always had good luck
with their service and it's actually cheaper for what we end up getting,
all told.

 While the guy was there he put in three new cable outlets (because not
all of the rooms in the house had them... still not all of them have
one, but I think there's only one room that doesn't that really might
need one). That was cool. Plus, due to the new outlets, I can now put
the cable modem right down next to the computer and connect directly to
the network. Previously I was having to connect through wireless
because, well, no cable drop was in the office. I'm movin' up in the
world, people!

 Sunday I spent the day playing [*Paper
Mario*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002ILS1K/mhsvortex)
with [Stu](http://www.stuartthompson.net), which was hella fun since
it'd been a couple of weeks since last we played. Made some good
progress there and also tried the Papa John's "Kong-Sized Pizza," which
was pretty ridiculously giant and filled us up nicely.

 I would probably be remiss in not saying that there are a couple of
friends of mine that are going through some hard times right now, so
time was spent with them during the weekend as well. I won't say more
than that, since it's not my place, but I hope they're doing well and
will continue to support them as needed.

 Less serious: just found the [*Red Dwarf* 8
DVD](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F4RH98/mhsvortex) is
coming out soon, and there's a limited edition with a motorized scutter
toy on it. Preordered!
