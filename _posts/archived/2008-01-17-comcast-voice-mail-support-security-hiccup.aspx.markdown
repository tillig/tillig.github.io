Okay, I thought this was pretty funny:

I noticed that if you access your voice mail through the Comcast web
site and delete it, if you later call up your voice mail from a phone,
deleted messages show up as "skipped." Looking at the FAQs they provide,
they say something about having to empty your "deleted items" folder on
the web site. But there is no "deleted items" folder. So I got into a
live chat with a support rep.

Turns out there's something weird going on, so the rep wanted a
technician to look into it. That's when this little blurb happened:

!["I hate to ask this but I will need your pass code for your voice
mail?"](https://hyqi8g.dm2304.livefilestore.com/y2pHLs4RKNADAbG2U3nHdgDl5SHRNFuTqDjBSF_pntDyDX3alwxdCTGOczZ9ojVQzcJhDf71M2XSDqaCzcTdcQneK8uAdDBUYtzpls6efrAZ7g/20080117comcastsupport.png?psid=1)

I didn't end up giving out my password, obviously - they ended up
"finding a workaround." Hehehehehe...
