If you have a business of 25 employees or less and you're looking for a
great unit testing mock/isolation product, Typemock has a screamin' deal
running until December 17: [**Get five developer licenses for Typemock
Isolator and one build server license for
\$80/month.**](https://www.plimus.com/jsp/redirect.jsp?contractId=2616274&referrer=tillig)

That's a pretty awesome deal. At current prices, it's \$799 for a
developer license and \$2499 for a build server license. It'd cost you
\$6494 for five dev licenses and a build server. A year of the same
licenses at \$80/month is just \$960. Not bad, eh?

Go [check out the
deal](https://www.plimus.com/jsp/redirect.jsp?contractId=2616274&referrer=tillig)
for more info, or just [pick yourself up some licenses while you
can](https://www.plimus.com/jsp/buynow.jsp?contractId=2616274&referrer=tillig).
Again, it's just running until December 17, so get in while you can!
