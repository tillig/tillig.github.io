The iTunes COM for Windows SDK seems to have been moved from the
location they originally had it -
http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html. It is now inside the
Apple Developer Connections site and you need [a free membership for
it](http://developer.apple.com/products/membership.html).

Once you have your membership and [log into the ADC
site](https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/promo?source=ADCLOG&code=ADCLOG-NEX),
go to Downloads -\> Developer Tools. About 1/3 of the way down the page
you'll find the iTunes COM for Windows SDK.

(You'll need this if you want to write scripts or programs to automate
iTunes from Windows. It used to be really easy to find, but now it's
buried, so here's a pointer.)
