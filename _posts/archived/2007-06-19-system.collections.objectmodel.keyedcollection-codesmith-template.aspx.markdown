I've been converting a .NET 1.1 project over to .NET 2.0 and there are a
lot of strongly-typed collections in the project that were generated by
[CodeSmith](http://www.codesmithtools.com/).  Most of these collections
were based on the ArrayList template that came bundled with CodeSmith
and all of them used the "GetByKey" facility the generator offered.

I'm trying to reduce the codebase and take advantage of generics where
possible to get rid of things like this.  To that end, I've been
converting most of these over to
[System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection\<T\>](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132438.aspx) (which
also jives nicely with FxCop - the generated collections came bundled
with several items that set FxCop off).

Ironically, that means I end up generating a very small amount of code
(and corresponding XML documentation) for each of these collections - a
class derived from KeyedCollection with the appropriate constructor
overloads and the override for the
[GetKeyForItem](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132454.aspx)
method.  So I made a - *wait for it* - CodeSmith template to do exactly
that.

If you're a CodeSmith user and you find yourself creating a lot of
simple KeyedCollection implementations, [grab the template and go to
it](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C2CB832A5EC9B707!45435&authkey=!AG1w6CwaJpd_yi0&ithint=file%2czip).
