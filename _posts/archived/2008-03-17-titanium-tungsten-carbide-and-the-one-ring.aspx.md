![Titanium "One
Ring"](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pWiDR4mSpFBfmurgFzzStSQmLHSkvIIEzSFON6TSzroUGxUiPKI-4A4qv3FOS7uZMK3AwcmdmBphNeONCX1Iew2flgMN7aoYWoWz5_EkHt5o/20060315ring.jpg?psid=1)[My
wedding ring](/archive/2006/03/15/my-ring-came-in.aspx) is a titanium
version of the One Ring from *Lord of the Rings*. I like it quite a bit,
but it was a real pain to get - the only place you could find them was
this German web site which seems to have disappeared since we bought it.
Plus, the black finish is beautiful but it scratches given a little
effort so you have to be careful. (Metal doorknobs can be problematic if
they turn hard, for example, so you have to be pretty mindful of what
you're doing.) Sort of lame considering I was going for
nigh-indestructible.

Anyway, in the event I have to re-order, I found a couple of options.
[Boone Titanium Rings](http://www.boonerings.com/) has a good general
selection and will let you submit custom artwork to [create your own
laser-etchedÂ titanium
ring](http://www.boonerings.com/htmpages/createyourown.htm). Now, that's
cool and all, but I think the one I'll go with will be [a tungsten
carbide diamond-etched "One Ring" from Forever
Metals](http://www.forevermetals.com/domed-tungsten-carbide-rings/one-ring-lord-of-the-rings/).

![Tungsten carbide "One Ring" from Forever
Metals.](https://hyqi8g.dm2303.livefilestore.com/y2pQbBtgVWjSBgrGz_IYbwJ6Uhq-XAi8HvOckpb9dItIHbJa3wxHE8MqrGQ2c1nUPvoC_SSysTLxXBw5ntJdUuteAGTtHl0KskRi0YEU0VSY90/20080317tungstencarbideonering.jpg?psid=1)

I admit a lot of ignorance when it comes to jewelery and metals and
such, so I didn't really fully understand the differences between
hardness and durability between titanium and tungsten carbide. There's
[an educational page on the Forever Metals site that explains tungsten
carbide](http://www.forevermetals.com/jewelry-tungsten-carbide-ring/)
and its benefits. Things like "scratch-proof" and "four times harder
than titanium" show up there, which makes it perfect for me.

Of course, Jenn got all worried about what happens in an emergency and
the doctors can't get the ring off your finger so they have to cut off
the finger instead. I thought I was already hosed with the titanium
ring, but apparently [you can cut titanium with almost any tool that
will cut
steel](http://www.cascadiadesignstudio.com/faq-cut-off-ring.htm),
including a Dremel. As for tungsten carbide, [Forever Metals
claims](http://www.forevermetals.com/jewelry-tungsten-carbide-ring/):

> Tungsten carbide ring can be removed by a medical professional. Rings
> made of extremely hard materials, like tungsten carbide or ceramic,
> can only be removed by cracking them into pieces with standard vice
> grip style locking pliers. Standard ring cutters will not work.

So I'm not screwed and shouldn't lose a finger as long as the medical
professional helping me has a pair of vice grips. I have to assume the
medical field has figured this one out. Or maybe I should get one of
those [MedicAlert bracelets](http://www.medicalert.org) that says,
"Don't cut off my finger, just get some channel locks."
