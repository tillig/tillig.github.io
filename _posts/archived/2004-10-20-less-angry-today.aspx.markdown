Okay, so, like, I was a little harsh yesterday, maybe. Not that I'm
recanting my opinion of general incompetence, but I do have to give
props to one of the guys in the namespace meeting yesterday who finally
came around and saw the importance of this and arrived at a solution
equitable for all parties ([you know who you
are](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/)).
 
 Anyway, I cranked up the tunes, stewed about it for several hours,
slept on it, woke up still pissed, and now I'm back at work, still
feeling a little feisty but not nearly as belligerent as yesterday.
 
 Not that it's really an excuse, but I just don't take to being set up
for failure too well. I continue to maintain that anyone can code; if
you want it done *right*, in a *quality* fashion, that's when you call
me in. I won't sacrifice quality, folks. It's against every fiber of my
being. We *will* get into it if the removal of quality from the project
is a goal (even if it's not explicitly stated - by providing conflicting
requirements and continually accelerating the development process to an
arbitrary, too-soon date, that's what you're asking for: low quality).
Not an option. Not on *my* watch.
