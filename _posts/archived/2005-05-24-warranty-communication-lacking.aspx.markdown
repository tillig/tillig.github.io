I called NEW (the warranty company servicing my TV extended warranty)
since they were supposed to have called me back this past Friday to tell
me what's going on with my TV - as it's unfixable, are they going to
replace it or refund my money?
 
 I talked to Dave over there, who is perhaps the most unhelpful customer
service representative ever. Not sure if you've talked to a Dave before,
but these are the customer service reps who use their position as an
excuse NOT to help you.
 
 Dave told me that NEW was waiting to hear form the TV repair place that
my TV was not fixable. I asked what could be done to help the process
along.
 
 Dave: They need to fax us their report that says the TV can't be
fixed.
 Me: OK. So can you call them and ask them to fax that or should I do
that?
 Dave: They need to fax us their report that says the TV can't be
fixed.
 Me: Right. Who needs to tell them that they need to fax you that
information?
 Dave: Normally what happens is they determine the TV to be unfixable,
then they fax us their report and tell us that so we can send it to
authorization.
 Me: I've got that. Who needs to call the repair firm and tell them to
fax that? Can you do it?
 Dave: I'm sorry, I'm just the customer service rep.
 
 That's great, Dave. Thanks.
 
 Turns out I called the repair place and they sent in their report like
two weeks ago.
 
 Time to get irritated...
