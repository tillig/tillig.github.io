They just came and got the TV for repair. Took three guys, one of which
said something about this being the heaviest TV he's had to deal with. I
warned 'em.
 
 Looking at the invoice, the tube's going to cost \$1632.89 and the
transport to the repair shop is \$370. Damn right, extended warranty.
 
 Of course, I just have to kind of hang out and wait for them to fix it
now. According to the transport guy, they don't have the tube yet, so
God only knows how long this is going to go on. I may have to move one
of the other TVs downstairs for a while.
