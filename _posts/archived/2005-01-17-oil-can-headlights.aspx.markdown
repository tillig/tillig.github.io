I completed [my headlight
quest](/archive/2005/01/15/on-a-headlight-mission.aspx) yesterday and as
a final step took the newly purchased bulb to the local Oil Can Henry's
to get it put into the car. They did it last time, too, and cost me \$10
for the job. I figure, it's \$10 worth of headache they're saving me,
and it's worth every penny.
 
 They serviced the car right there in the parking lot - I didn't even
have to drive into the garage. That said, it did take about half an hour
to finish. (Which I expected; it's a real pain to get into my
headlights. You have to take, like, half the engine out to get there.)
 
 When all was said and done, the guy went in to run my debit card and
came back, saying all of the registers were being used and to just
forget it - it was on the house. He just said, "Come in for your next
oil change, eh?"
 
 I actually felt bad - the guy had worked his ass off for that \$10 and
he didn't even take it. He just wanted the repeat business for later.
 
 *That's* customer service. Sort of the way [Les
Schwab](http://www.lesschwab.com/) will fix flat tires for free. I'll
definitely be hitting Oil Can Henry's in the future, and if you get the
opportunity, I recommend it (at least, the one in Tanasbourne,
Hillsboro, OR). They're good people.
