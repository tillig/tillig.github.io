Â 

Just like [I use the "Join Lines" function a
lot](/archive/2005/08/30/cr_joinlines---join-lines-in-visual-studio-code-editor-via.aspx),
I also sort lines a lot in text editing. That's another feature Visual
Studio didn't have that I wanted - the ability to sort lines.
 
 CR\_SortLines adds a command ("Sort Lines") that you can bind to a
keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+F9 is what I use) and will sort lines in the
code editor.

 Installation is as easy as copying a DLL into a folder and adding the
keyboard shortcut. The included readme.txt outlines installation, usage,
and workarounds for known issues.
 
 Requires DXCore 1.1.40 or later ([DXCore is a **FREE** download from
Developer Express - go get
it!](http://www.devexpress.com/Downloads/NET/DXCore/)).
