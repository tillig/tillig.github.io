[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 7]
 
 ![Tre
Limone](https://hyqi8g.blu.livefilestore.com/y2pCAy05SoF8W1_rWRdmLtIBHd6LhgThf7ZWjzRsqokS6T_BLlo_afDn5ET8_UIeVLVCp6aAElb_-SW-ACQLyja4nz0pMjftDcqZmUDs3WXjNg/20020507trelimonekq1.gif?psid=1)Only
a week until Jenn & I hit the streets of
[Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx), and I'm stoked. The
only problem is, the closer I get to vacation, the longer the time seems
to go. I'm afraid this week is going to last *forever* and next week
will only be a heartbeat. Such is the way of the vacation.
 
 It's been a while since I've had one, but I have to say, [Tr√©
Limone](http://trelimone.com) is one of the greatest beverages *ever*.
(Their web site takes forever to get past the intro, though, so you'll
want to jump right to the [product
section](http://www.trelimone.com/product/).) It's difficult to find in
the Portland area, but I found that the [Haggen](http://www.haggen.com)
by my work stocks it, so *yay, me!* I bought one to nurse in today's
staff meeting at work. It's the little things. ([Flying Elephant's
Delicatessen](http://www.portlandprogress.com/about-business-directory-alphabetical.shtml#f)
in downtown Portland also has it, in case you wondered.)
 
 I realized last night that I forgot to wear my [Spider-Man "No. 1
Amazing
Fantasy"](http://www.fossil.com/Collectors/CWArchive/CWACategory.asp?Tier1=Collectibles&Tier2=CA&Dept_ID=CA&ID=CWA3&CatID=33)
watch when I went to the movie. I don't wear it much because I don't
want it to get all dinged up (I'm pretty hard on my watch; it's a good
thing my regular watch is pretty durable). It's really cool, though. My
parents got it for my birthday a few years back.
 
 Speaking of cool watches, I like the [Dumbledore's Pocket
Watch](http://www.fossil.com/Product/Product.asp?Tier1=Collectibles&Tier2=CC&Dept%5FID=CC&Cat%5FID=CO2&Prod%5FID=LI2035)
that [Fossil](http://www.fossil.com/) has out. (*Hint, hint...*)
 
 Well, time for staff meeting. And donut eating.
