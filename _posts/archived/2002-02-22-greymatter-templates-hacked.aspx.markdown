I realize this probably is of interest to no one but me, but I was able
to successfully hack the [Greymatter](http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/)
back end and create a little script that will allow me to dynamically
include the templates from Greymatter directly into my other HTML pages
(provided, of course, SSI is enabled). Which means it'll be much easier
to create my other pages and give them all a standard look. I added my
[resume](/about/resume.php) and updated it to be current... looks pretty
good. Now I just need to add back in some of the "about" pages and a
fix-up of the Gen<sup>13</sup> section and I'll be good to go.
