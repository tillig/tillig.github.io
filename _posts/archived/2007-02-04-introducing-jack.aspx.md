Everyone, I'd like to introduce Jack:

 ![This is
Jack!]({{ site.url }}/images/20070204jack_face.jpg)

 Jack is our new kitten, an eight-week-old Siamese/Tabby mix. You can
see his body is light tan with white stripes, while his tail is dark
brown with white stripes. It's fairly subtle coloring on his body, but
it's really cool. He also has bright blue eyes like a Siamese.

stripes.]({{ site.url }}/images/20070204jack_side.jpg)

 He's wild - really wild - which is fun and will be good for our other
cat once she warms up to him. She's needed a playmate for some time.
(Right now she's being very territorial, but I don't think she'll be
able to hold out for long - she just wants to be loved and you can tell
she's just jealous of the new baby.)

 This little guy has more energy than I know what to do with, but once
he's played for *a couple of hours straight*, he crashes pretty hard.

 ![Say goodnight,
Jack.]({{ site.url }}/images/20070204jack_tired.jpg)

 We name our cats after TV show characters we like, and this one is Jack
for Jack Bauer (from *24*) and Jack Bristow (from *Alias*). (Our other
cat is Xev, from *Lexx*.)

 Some folks post baby pictures, I post cat pictures. So there you have
it - the new addition to the Illig clan!
