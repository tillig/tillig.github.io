I'm in a reasonably good mood today, though I'm not sure why. I've got a
dentist appointment later on which makes me irritated just thinking
about it, so I won't. Of course, now that I've said out loud that I'm in
a good mood, I'm sure it'll disintegrate like that much cotton candy. I
can feel it leaving me now.
 
 On the way in to work today, I was thinking about stuff that puts me in
a good mood. There are lots of things, but here are a few (*...these are
a few of my favorite things...*):

-   Great 80's music (including, but not limited to):
    -   The Outfield - *Your Love*
    -   Hall & Oates - *Out of Touch*
    -   Laura Branigan - *Self Control*

-   A stereo with great clarity and better bass
-   Alphonse Mucha artwork
-   Acquiring new technology
-   New CDs and DVDs
-   Going to the movies
-   Biting my tiny Xev cat (just little ones; she purrs when you bite
    her... but she purrs when you give her any attention at all)
-   Las Vegas

Then I started thinking about things that piss me off, and realized that
the list of things that irritate me is much longer than the list of
things that make me happy. Stuff that pisses me off to no end (again,
including, but not limited to):

-   The font [*MS Comic
    Sans*](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/fonts/comicsns/default.htm)
-   People who just
    [can't](/archive/2002/04/02/a-public-safety-announcement.aspx)
    [figure](/archive/2002/06/13/west-end-traffic.aspx)
    [out](/archive/2002/11/04/another-traffic-lesson.aspx) [how to
    drive](/archive/2002/12/09/crash.aspx)
-   People with no [bathroom
    etiquette](/archive/2002/02/28/the-previously-unwritten-rules-of-bathroom-etiquette.aspx)
-   Stupid people
-   [Improper

    (and, more importantly, [overt
    abuse](http://www.salon.com/news/col/huff/2002/12/17/apostrophe/?x))
    of apostrophes
-   People who tell you they'll be somewhere and then don't show up
-   People who are consistently late
-   [Bumper stickers](/archive/2002/03/22/bumper-statements.aspx)
-   Industrial carpet
-   People who, when you send them an email that's high priority and the
    first line is bold red caps that say **PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE
    EMAIL**, don't read the email and then send you questions about
    stuff you answered two lines into the note
-   Users
-   Professional sales people - not retail sales, just the ones you
    refer to when you say "I'm having a *vendor* stop in today"

And the list goes on, but that's a decent start.
 
 Saturday Jenn and I went to
[LaserPort](http://www.laserportofbeaverton.com/) to play laser tag with
our friends Jason and Tracy, along with Tracy's sister, Crystal, and her
friends Erin and Wayne. At least, I think the guy's name was Wayne. I
never really heard it properly.
 
 That was a lot of fun, though I'm *way* out of shape. My legs are a bit
stiff today (yes, two days later) which just further indicates that I
need to be in better shape.
 
 Sunday we went to see [*Shanghai
Knights*](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0300471) (which was fun, though I
think I liked the first one just slightly better). We were supposed to
see it with my friend Torin, who decided not to show up. I still don't
know where he was or anything, but I can't say I wasn't a bit pissed.
 
 The thing is, like 90% of my friends are like that. They say they'll be
somewhere and then they show up really late, if at all. There's always
an excuse generally along the lines of "something suddenly came up" or
"I was doing something else and lost track of time." You know what? I'm
tired of it. I'm tired of being the guy who shows up on time and then
has to save seats in the theater for everyone else. I'm tired of being
the guy who organizes everything at everyone else's request only to have
no one show up.
 
 Here's a little anecdote about that: The last place I worked, FatEarth
(a startup that no longer exists), I was there with several people in my
general age group and we were all pretty good friends. People would have
parties at their houses/apartments, and we'd all get together and go.
The whole time, they'd bug me about when *I* was going to have a party
at my place. After enough harping, I agreed to have a party. I figured
out when everyone was available, sent out invites, got the drinks and
food together, cleaned the place up, and waited for people to show.
 
 No one did. People responded and said they'd be there, but no one
showed.
 
 So now I have a new rule - *no fucking parties*. Hey, if people won't
bother showing up - even after they said they would - then I won't
bother having parties. Less trouble for me.
 
 Jenn and I talk about that a lot, actually. Who we want to go do stuff
with, who's fun to hang out with... then we realize that most of our
friends, even if we plan something, won't show up. It's a little
disheartening. I mean, sure, there are definitely those who do make it,
and we do hang out with those folks. But it's hard to be excited about
getting together with someone who can't be counted on to show up on
time, if at all.
 
 Hey, great. There goes my good mood.
