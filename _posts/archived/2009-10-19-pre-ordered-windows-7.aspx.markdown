[![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mqYLz8fKL._SL160_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MV2MG0?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002MV2MG0)I
went ahead and pre-ordered my upgrades for Windows 7 today. I opted to
get the "family pack" upgrade - [three licenses to upgrade to Windows 7
Home Premium for
\$150](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MV2MG0?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002MV2MG0).
At \$50/license, I couldn't say no. I'll start the upgrade with [my
Media Center front
ends](/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx) and
do our primary laptop last, just so if anything happens to go south I'll
always have a working computer to go searching for help/fixes. Not that
I anticipate anything going wrong, just... well, things that should be
easy never are for me. I always seem to find that one edge case.

Anyway, if you're looking to upgrade more than one computer, [that
three-pack](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MV2MG0?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002MV2MG0)
might be the way to go. Considering [a single upgrade license for
Windows 7 Home Premium is
\$120](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHLUWK?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002DHLUWK),
three licenses for \$150 is a steal.
