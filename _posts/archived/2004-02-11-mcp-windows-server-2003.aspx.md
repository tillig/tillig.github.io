I took slightly less than a minute per question on my latest Microsoft
certification test, *MS 070-290: Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft
Windows Server 2003 Environment*, and I think I missed all of three
questions total. A passing score was 700, I got 760, and from the way
the results graph looks, it seems that 800 was the best possible score.
Out of 45 questions, that's not too bad.

 Only one more test and I'll have the [Microsoft Certified Database
Administrator](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcdba/default.asp)
certification (to add to my [Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer in
.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcsd/default.asp)
certification). Meaningless paper? Possibly. Worth something in the job
market? Most definitely.
