No, not [the *Seinfeld*
episode](http://www.stanthecaddy.com/the-serenity-now-script.html).
 
 If you haven't seen
[*Serenity*](http://browncoats.serenitymovie.com/serenity/index.html?fuseaction=tools.invlink&u=tillig&linkID=36),
you have to see this movie. Seriously. Don't believe me? [Get sucked in
by watching the first nine
minutes.](http://video.vividas.com/CDN1/3929_Serenity/web/index.html)
 
 I'm wearing my *Serenity* shirt today (which you can get from [Power
Star Merchandise](http://www.tvmerch.com/)), and I'm ready to go see
that bad boy *again*.
