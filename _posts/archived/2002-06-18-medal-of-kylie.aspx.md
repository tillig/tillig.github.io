Yesterday I went on a mission to find *[Medal of Honor:
Frontline](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V6BB/mhsvortex)*
for the PS2. I went to two different [Fred
Meyer](http://www.fredmeyer.com) stores and neither had it.

 They did, however, have the [Kylie Minogue](http://www.kylie.com/)
album,
*[Fever](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y228/mhsvortex)*.

 I bought it, and I dig it thoroughly.

 I don't think there's really a *bad* song on there. I definitely have
my favorites, but I don't out-and-out *dislike* any of them. Never
really having listened to her before, I am very pleasantly surprised. I
may have to pick up some of her other albums.

 Anyway, back to the *Medal of Honor* discussion.

 So I went to two different stores yesterday with no luck. I called
another one once I got home, though, and they said they were getting a
shipment in overnight and they should be on the shelves by morning.

 I stopped in this morning and they weren't on the damn shelves.

 They *were*, however, in the freight boxes, still unpacked. I got one
fresh out of the box and bought it immediately. Hopefully it will prove
to be vastly less frustrating than *[Devil May
Cry](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NCCR/mhsvortex)* was.

 For the techies out there: The project I'm working on at work has taken
a downward turn. It turns out there's a memory leak in the PKMCDO object
library somewhere that causes the program I wrote to just *eat up
memory* like nothing else. So the code is getting a significant overhaul
to lower my reliance on the problem library while we look into getting
Microsoft to fix the memory leak (or tell us how to work around it).
