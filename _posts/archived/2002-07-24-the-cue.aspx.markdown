Surprisingly enough, the birthday barbecue last night went off without a
hitch.
 
 People in attendance:
-   Grandma and Grandpa (Dad's parents)
-   Granddad (Mom's father)
-   Tori (sister)
-   Tai (sister) and Dan (Tai's fiancee)
-   Mom and Dad
-   Jenn
-   Dan and Aggie (Jenn's parents)


 
 Dad cooked up some burgers on the grill and we had chips, dip, and
various fruit/vegetable salads. We also had a [Grand
Marnier](http://www.grandmarnier.com/) chocolate cake (my favorite) from
JaCiva's, a local chocolatier, courtesy of Jenn. Mom got me some
[*Monsters,
Inc.*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKDR/mhsvortex)
plates, napkins, and tablecloths, which were fun. People seemed to get
along pretty well and there was no drunken brawling, so I would consider
it a success.
 
 This was actually the first event that my parents and Jenn's parents
have spent any time together at. They seemed to get along rather well,
especially our fathers, who talked about model trains and remote control
[HumVees](http://www.hummer.com/) most of the night.
 
 The gifts were plentiful and all were cool (which is a rarity... You
know how you usually get that one gift and you're speechless because it
wasn't remotely anything you wanted? That didn't happen.). I got:
-   From Tori, a funky zebra puppet that I can torment my kitty Xev
    with; and a [*Survivor* board
    game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WHR4/mhsvortex)
    that looks like quite a lot of fun
-   From Tai, an electronic meat thermometer fork (I barbecue a lot, so
    that'll be handy)
-   From Dad's parents, a check (you can always use money); and a
    windchime that has hung in their kitchen for, well, my entire
    lifetime as far as I know... very cool, since it totally reminds me
    of them
-   From Jenn's parents, a small refrigerator/freezer to go under my
    desk at work
-   From my parents, a [strategy guide for *Medal of Honor:
    Frontline*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761537678/mhsvortex);
    a big box of [Crest Whitestrips](http://www.whitestrips.com/) (is
    that a hint?); and... a small refrigerator/freezer to go under my
    desk at work


 
 Yes, that means I have two refrigerators. Great minds think alike, eh?
Interestingly enough, the two are actually identical items with
different brands attached to them. Too funny. So I've got one plugged in
here at work now doing its thing and the other will get returned for...
well, I don't know yet. I've gotta think about what I want instead.
Maybe some binoculars or a digital camera. I'm not sure how much the
fridges cost.
 
 All in all, a rather successful celebration. Tonight Jenn and I will
have dinner at Veritable Quandary downtown and then see [*Phantom of the
Opera*](http://www.thephantomoftheopera.com/). I'm looking forward to a
brilliant evening.
