and I went with some friends on Sunday to see
*[Wall-E](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/)*, the latest Pixar
piece.

I enjoyed *[Toy Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/)* and it
holds a special place in my heart. I have enjoyed all of the other Pixar
movies, too, to varying degrees.

*Wall-E* is my new favorite. There's just something about cute robots
that I can't get over. The characters - most of them robots - were
lovable and full of personality, the story was great... I was sucked in
from the first minute. Something I thought was cool was that they did so
much, particularly at the beginning, without a ton of dialogue. It was
all in expressions and actions, and it was amazing.

While it's obviously safe for kids to see, I don't think they'll really
get it. I know that my niece was sort of bored by it. My sister-in-law
fell asleep (she's *fired*). Jenn, I, and the friends we went with loved
it thoroughly. Definitely worth the full-price admission in my book.
