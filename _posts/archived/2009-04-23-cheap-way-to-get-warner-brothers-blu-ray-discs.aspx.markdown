Warner Brothers has [created a service called
Red2Blu](http://www.red2blu.com)Â that lets you convert your HD DVD
collection into Blu-Ray by sending them \$5 per HD DVD title along with
the paper insert from the case. You keep the disc, just send the cover
art.

Combine that with [iNetVideo.com, a clearing house for old HD
DVDs](http://search.inetvideo.com/search?w=hd+dvd&view=grid). You can
get some as low as \$1.99.

Let's say you want *300* on Blu-Ray. [At Amazon, it's
\$22.49](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX5Y?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000Q6GX5Y).
On the other hand, you can get [the HD DVD for
\$1.99](http://www.inetvideo.com/Items/N01-0110541) at iNetVideo.com and
upgrade at Red2Blu for \$4.99. That's a total of \$6.98 for the movie,
saving you \$15.51.

Now, you've got to consider shipping costs - it's \$6.95 shipping for
the Red2Blu conversion on an order up to 25 discs and the shipping from
iNetVideo varies - so you wouldn't want to do just one movie... but if
you have several, like if you want all of the Harry Potter movies or
something, you can save a bundle.
