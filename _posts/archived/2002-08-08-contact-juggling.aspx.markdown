After watching the Fox show [*30 Seconds to
Fame*](http://www.fox.com/30secondstofame/) last night, my interest was
rekindled in an art called "Contact Juggling."
 
 What is it? Well, unless you've seen it, it's hard to describe. Better
to explain why I'm interested and let you figure it out for yourself.
 
 I first got sucked in by it while watching
[*Labyrinth*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K3D4/mhsvortex),
one of my favorite movies (with an awesome
[soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002U9L/mhsvortex),
too). You know the part where David Bowie's character has the crystal
ball and is rolling it around on his arms in one fluid motion? That's
contact juggling.
 
 And, just for the record, that wasn't David Bowie doing it. It was
actually a guy named [Michael Moschen](http://www.michaelmoschen.com),
who seems to be the foremost authority on it.
 
 Anyway, I am just thoroughly impressed every time I see it done, and
I've admittedly screwed around trying to imitate it, but not having much
luck and usually hurting myself in the process.
 
 Well, last night's *30 Seconds to Fame* (which has to be one of the
dumber shows out there overall) had a guy named Owen doing this contact
juggling thing, so I once again got the bug up my ass and decided I
needed to see if the art was a little more accessible than it was
before.
 
 Lucky for me, it is.
 
 Now there are web sites on the thing.
[ContactJuggling.org](http://www.contactjuggling.org) and
[ContactJuggling.com](http://www.contactjuggling.com) are the two I've
found to be most helpful. They've got resources and step by step guides
- even videos - that show you the beginning steps. It looks to me like
the best place to start is with a lacrosse ball. Guess I'm going to the
sporting goods store sometime soon.
 
 There's a
[book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963405403/mhsvortex) out,
too, but it looks like it's sort of hard to get ahold of. I can't
recommend it one way or the other 'cause I've never seen it. I'll
probably end up getting it, though.
 
 In other news...
 
 My [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com) jersey came back,
professionally lettered and looking crisp. Love it. Can't wait for an
occasion to wear it.
 
 My [Ottawa Senators
jersey](http://shop.nhl.com/itmModelList.asp?s={2652B09B-A8F3-4F79-AE65-C35B857C07D3}&l=1&a=10088&c=8036&sf=2&cnl=3&i=10279)
is also at my house, waiting to be unleashed from the box it was shipped
in. I'd wear it tomorrow to my sister's wedding, but I think she'd be
pissed.
 
 Oh, and I added a link to [buy Mucha art from
AllPosters.com](http://www.allposters.com/gallery.asp?aid=273632&search=alphonse+mucha).
In the event you're looking for some cool stuff to hang up (or stuff to
buy me), there you go.
 
 Finally, I took out the "Karma voting" feature of the blog because,
frankly, no one was using it and it just cluttered stuff up. If it
sounds like it'll be a good idea at a later time, I can always re-enable
it. Comments will still be allowed (and encouraged), so no change
there.
