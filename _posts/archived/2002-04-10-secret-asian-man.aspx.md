[Days Until [Vegas](/archive/2002/04/08/vegas-baby-vegas.aspx): 34]
 
 Talking to Jenn a couple of nights ago, she mentioned that when she was
younger she thought the song "Secret Agent Man" was actually saying
"Secret Asian Man." I thought that was pretty clever and funny.
[Apparently other folks do, too.](http://www.gamh.cx/songs/sam.html) I
thought it would make a good [Cartoon
Network](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/) show. Or a character on
[Samurai Jack](http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/jack/index.html) or
something. Then again, I don't watch any of those shows, so for all I
know, it's already there.
 
 My mom's birthday is today. I, as usual, didn't remember until my
parents called me yesterday to tell me when we are all getting together
for dinner in celebration (tomorrow). Which means I need to do some
seriously hasty shopping tonight to get a gift. Of course, Dad doesn't
know what Mom wants and Mom doesn't ever really specify anything she
wants, so I'll be guessing. Hopefully something will call to me at the
store tonight.
 
 I never remember birthdays (or any other holidays, for that matter). I
know three dates: My birthday, Christmas, and my parents' anniversary. I
only know their anniversary because it's two days before my birthday
(but, uh, two? years earlier, chronologically) and Mom sometimes calls
me on their anniversary to wish me happy birthday. Then she remembers
that she swapped the dates around and runs out anniversary shopping or
something. Heh.
 
 I watched [MTV's](http://www.mtv.com) *[The
Osbournes](http://www.mtv.com/onair/osbournes/)* for the first time last
night, and I have to say that I found it pretty funny. That's the first
show on MTV that I've seen in, well, years that has actually held my
attention. Ozzy cracks me up, especially when he's playing with his
bulldog. I may have to become a regular watcher.
