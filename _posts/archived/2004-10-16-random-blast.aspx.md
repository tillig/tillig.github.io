No one particular thing driving this post, more just a random blast of
thoughts and items.

 The [Winter Hawks](http://www.winterhawks.com/) canned the best (in my
opinion) player on the team, [Robin Big
Snake](http://www.oregonlive.com/hawks/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/sports/10976688818100.xml),
apparently because he was being a little mouthy. Apparently he's now
playing for the [Owen Sound Attack](http://www.attackhockey.com/)
(whoever that is). I'm still trying to [piece it all
together](http://portlandtribune.com/archview.cgi?id=26636), but it's
sounding like *scandal*. Heh.

 I was a big fan of [*Schoolhouse
Rock*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKTY/mhsvortex), and
while [this](http://www.piratesandemperors.com/) isn't real *Schoolhouse
Rock*, it's a pretty funny take on it. Check it out - [*Pirates and
Emperors*](http://www.piratesandemperors.com/).

 We watched the [*Star Wars*
movies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXCT/mhsvortex)
last week and now I'm really itching for a [Millennium
Falcon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00020LZ6Q/mhsvortex).
Anyone love me enough to pony up? No? [Darth Vader's Tie
Fighter](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005MKXG/mhsvortex)
maybe? Guess I'll have to save up a bit (after [the
tires](/archive/2004/10/11/new-tires.aspx) last week, I'm running a
little low on funds).
