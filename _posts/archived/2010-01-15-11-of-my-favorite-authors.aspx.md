A while ago a friend of mine asked me for the names of some of the
authors I read. This got me thinking and I figured I'd make a list of a
few of my favorites. So, in no particular order...

 

**[!["Neuromancer" by William
Gibson](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71oXwkf7FRL._SS200_.jpg ""Neuromancer" by William Gibson")](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441569595?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0441569595)
[**William
Gibson**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FWilliam-Gibson%2FB000AP5DM0%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fpel%255Fpop%255F1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)**:
I've read
[*Neuromancer*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441569595?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0441569595)
so many times the book has nearly fallen apart. I like how he describes
things enough to get a vivid image in your head but not with such
numbing detail you get bogged down. Plus, how can you deny the guy who
coined the term "cyberspace?" I've read all of his books and I have yet
to find one I didn't like.

[**Richard K.
Morgan**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FRichard-K.-Morgan%2FB000APOIZS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263583834%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Morgan has created a future world where your personality lives in a
"cortical stack" at the base of your skull and a character named Takeshi
Kovacs is an ex special-forces soldier turned investigator for hire.
Action packed and a really fun read, [*Altered
Carbon*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345457692?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345457692)
is the first book in that series.

[**Tom
Clancy**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FTom-Clancy%2FB000APF4T2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263584167%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Clancy's sort of hit-or-miss. I've read some of his books that just take
freaking forever to get where they're going, but others are really
exciting. Most of the books revolve around a modern-day wartime
environment. I particularly liked [*Rainbow
Six*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425170349?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0425170349).

[**Jeff
Noon**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FJeff-Noon%2FB000AQ40AK%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263584329%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Noon writes in a very distinctive style that seems to resonate for some
folks but not as much for others. If it works for you, it really works,
and the books are amazing. His primary series revolves around a world
where we exchange objects between our world and a parallel world and
what comes back is a powerful hallucinogenic drug... that you take by
sticking a feather in your mouth. If you think it sounds weird, you're
right, it is... but it's a very compelling universe, too. The first book
in the series,
[*Vurt*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312141440?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312141440),
brings with it the added challenge that it's written in an invented
dialect so it may take a bit to get into, but give it a shot. when I was
done with it, I immediately flipped back to the first page and read it
again.

[!["Vurt" by Jeff
Noon](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UOwXTLAOL.AA200.jpg ""Vurt" by Jeff Noon")](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312141440?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312141440)
[**Steve
Aylett**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FSteve-Aylett%2FB000APE80I%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263584876%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
I'll admit I've only read one of Aylett's books -
[*Slaughtermatic*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568581033?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1568581033)
- but it was so good I have to include him here. In this particular
book, the world is a place where crime is a form of recreation and time
travel is possible. It's admittedly a little convoluted, but a really
fantastic read.

[**Philip
Pullman**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FPhilip-Pullman%2FB000AQ74C6%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263585126%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Specifically, Pullman's "His Dark Materials" trilogy which starts with
[*The Golden
Compass*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440418321?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0440418321)
(also made into a movie). In this world, your soul is physically
embodied as a "daemon" - an animal that travels with you. When the movie
came out a lot of stink got raised about the social commentary on
organized religion that these books present, but I really feel like that
was a lot of crap. Is there some commentary? Sure. Is it as important or
prevalent as the folks out there would like you to think? I don't think
so. This is another set of books I've read several times and enjoy every
time.

[!["The Looking Glass Wars" by Frank
Beddor](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QXd-ThaTL.AA200.jpg ""The Looking Glass Wars" by Frank Beddor")](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142409413?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142409413)
[**Frank
Beddor**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FFrank-Beddor%2FB001JRZREC%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fpel%255F1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
I am an *Alice in Wonderland* freak. I love the story, the characters,
and I love imaginative derivatives of it. Beddor has created my favorite
reimagining with his "Looking Glass Wars" trilogy - the idea being that
Wonderland is a real place and Alyss Heart is a real person who ends up
crossing into our world and getting trapped. Not difficult reads but
some of my favorites. There's even [a
soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L22UU0?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000L22UU0)
that goes along with them.

[**Neal
Stephenson**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FNeal-Stephenson%2FB000APS8L8%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fpel%255Fpop%255F1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Again, sort of hit-or-miss for me, but I can't recommend more strongly
that everyone read [*Snow
Crash*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553380958).
Where else would you find a place where pizza delivery is controled by
the mob and it arrives at your house via a guy you refer to as "The
Deliverator?" Cyberpunk action at its finest.

[**Neil
Gaiman**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FNeil-Gaiman%2FB000AQ01G2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263586268%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
Is there a "favorite authors" list Gaiman *isn't* on? Every story is
different and imaginative in its own right, but my absolute, all-time
favorite, and one that I have yet to find anyone disappointed with, is
his collaboration with Terry Pratchett: [*Good
Omens*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060853972?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060853972).
Of course, if you were offended by the "commentary" in Philip Pullman's
"His Dark Materials" series, *Good Omens* is probably not for you... but
otherwise it's a must-read.

[**Douglas
Adams**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FDouglas-Adams%2FB000AQ2A84%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Ftc%255F2%255F0%26qid%3D1263586507%26sr%3D1-2-ent&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
[The Hitchhiker's Guide
series](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345453743?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345453743)
are some favorites for me (and a ton of other people) and I've loved
them since I was a kid. One of the best birthday gifts I've gotten was a
leather-bound copy of the first four books in the series. I've read
them, listened to the audio books (on tape!), seen the movies/TV
shows... I can't get enough. Truly funny stuff.

[!["Jennifer Government" by Max
Barry](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QC2KGBDVL.AA200.jpg ""Jennifer Government" by Max Barry")](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400030927?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400030927)[**Max
Barry**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FMax-Barry%2FB001IXMF4W%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr%255Fntt%255Fsrch%255Flnk%255F1%26qid%3D1263586672%26sr%3D1-1&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957):
You also might see him listed as "Maxx Barry" but he seems to have
changed that in recent times. I discovered Barry through his book
[*Jennifer
Government*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400030927?ie=UTF8&tag=mhsvortex&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400030927):
Welcome to a place where enterprise has taken over enough that your last
name is the name of the company where you work and a shoe manufacturer
tries to earn "street cred" for his shoes by killing people who buy
them. His subsequent efforts are no less interesting or imaginative.
Barry's another one where I've read all of his books and love them all.

 

If you're looking for something new to read, maybe check some of these
out. If you do, drop me a line and let me know what you think.
