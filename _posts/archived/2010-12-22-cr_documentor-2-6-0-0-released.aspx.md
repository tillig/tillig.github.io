I posted a new version of
[CR\_Documentor](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com) as a compatibility
fix for the latest CodeRush/Refactor/DXCore. Some assemblies moved
around in DXCore and caused CR\_Documentor to fail to load. The latest
version fixes that.

As always, free - [go get it](http://cr-documentor.googlecode.com/)!
