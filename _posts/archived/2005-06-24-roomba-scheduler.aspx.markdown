While you're [waiting for the
Scooba](http://irobot.com/consumer/scooba_sneak_preview.cfm), check out
the [Roomba
Scheduler](http://irobot.com/consumer/product_detail.cfm?prodid=52): It
allows you to program your Roomba to automatically run at scheduled
times.
 
 Of course, if you already have a Roomba, you can just [add on the
scheduling
capability](http://irobot.com/consumer/product_detail.cfm?prodid=51).
