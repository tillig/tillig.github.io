I usually go all-out for Halloween and create a pretty elaborate
costume. This year I don't think I'll be able to because the wedding
planning and execution will be taking up too much time.
 
 I've always wanted to go as a Ghostbuster, though. I've never really
found great plans or anything, though, and I don't own a machine shop to
do all the custom work needed. [This guy made a pretty dang good
one](http://www.instructables.com/id/EKH0XWT89LES9J6ZK2/?ALLSTEPS),
though, and mostly out of wood, which is something I can work with
Dremel-style.
 
 Turns out the key to the whole thing is decent plans (as you'd have
guessed), which he got from [this site](http://www.hprops.com/labels/).
That and [some
patches](http://www.patchgeeks.com/catalog/index.php/cPath/26) will take
you a long way.
 
 Maybe I'll get on this for next year.
