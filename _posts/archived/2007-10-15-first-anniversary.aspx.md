Sunday was [my first wedding
anniversary](http://paraesthesia.com/archive/2006/10/27/the-royal-wedding.aspx).

It wasn't, like, super special or ultra-romantic or anything because,
well... Jenn and I have really been together for closer to eight years,
not just one.  Plus we've got a trip to Las Vegas planned in a week or
so and we're going to [a show down there](http://www.mgmgrand.com/ka)
and such, so we have already spent our anniversary budget on that.

Instead, we got each other cards and went with our friends Angela and
Keaka to see *[Resident Evil:
Extinction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432021/)*.  Like I said - the
romance abounded.  (RE was pretty decent.  I had fun with the previous
two movies and this one was about on par.  It ended really quickly...
but I guess you can't complain much about the third movie in a series
based on a video game.)

After that, we went for some cocktails, courtesy of Angela and Keaka
(thanks!) at [Dessert Noir](http://dessertnoir.com/), a pretty decent,
but sort of pricey, little cafe near the theater.  I had a tasty
chocolate/cherry concoction and Jenn had a coffee-based beverage.

Not a bad little first anniversary when all was said and done.  I can't
say it didn't just sneak up on me, but I didn't forget.

The rest of the weekend - Saturday and part of Sunday - was spent
working on my Halloween costume, sewing.  I always forget how hard it is
to put sleeves in.  I'm working on a jacket that's part of my costume
and I got the sleeves in... but they puckered at the seam a bit, which
is disappointing.  I'd like to blame the pattern for leaving too much
extra fabric on the sleeve at the top where it joins to the body, but I
suppose if I was a better tailor I'd be able to accommodate for that.  I
think it'll be okay; it'll withstand a cursory inspection.
