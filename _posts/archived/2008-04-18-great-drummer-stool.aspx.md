and have a great time with it. Problem is, my dining room chairs aren't
great for drumming. They're a little low and generally bulky compared to
what I need when I'm rocking out. I ended up finding [the "Vitamin"
stool at Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90118811) and
it's perfect.

-   Adjustable height.
-   Comfortable seat.
-   Tolerant of the need to lean forward or backward (at least if you're
    playing on carpet)Â - underneath the bottom is sort of angled on the
    edges.

Plus, it's pretty reasonably priced. If you're looking for a good
drummer stool, grab yourself one of these.
