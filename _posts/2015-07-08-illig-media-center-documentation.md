Over the years I've posted about my home media center developments. [Back in 2008]({{ site.url }}/archive/2008/09/30/overview-of-my-media-center-solution.aspx/) I posted a summary with links to articles, then I did [another roundup in 2014]({{ site.url }}/archive/2014/11/18/media-server-overview-2014/).

The problem with this sort of periodic summary is that it's hard to get an accurate picture of how things are working _right now_. I might forget to blog it, or I'll take some notes on something I found and forget to post it, or whatever.

I was keeping my media center and home networking notes in a personal wiki on [PBworks](http://www.pbworks.com/) but I figured it was time to make things a bit more official.

**[My media center and home network documentation is now live at illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/)**

This is the place I'll add notes or tips on how my media center setup works. I've got everything from [the hardware I use](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hardware/index.html) to [my process for getting video content into the system](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/processes/video.html). I've got my [plan and analysis for how I cut cable](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plans/cuttingthecable.html) including cost breakdowns and options. It's all on this site.

My biggest problem in getting my media center going was that I didn't know what I didn't know. Information about all this stuff - hardware, software, how to get things done - is spread out all over the place. I never found a complete guide to help me on my way.

**[I hope this documentation can help you jump start your media center or improve the one you have.](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/)** As things change in my system, I'll be keeping the documentation here up to date so it should always have the latest info.
