[A couple of years back I bought some Samsung TecTiles](/archive/2012/07/17/quick-overview-of-samsung-tectiles.aspx) for use with my Galaxy S3. I created a tag that would easily switch my phone to vibrate mode at work - get to work, scan it, magic.

Within the last couple of weeks I upgraded to a Galaxy Note 4 and when I tried to use the Note 4 on my TecTile I got a message saying the tag type wasn't supported.

A little research revealed that the TecTiles I bought are "MIFARE Classic" format, which [are apparently not universally compatible](http://www.andytags.com/nfc-tags-compatibility-issues.html#.VKwTyivF8k0). So... crap. If I want to mess around with NFC, I'm going to need to get some different tags. These TecTiles can't be read by any device I have in my home anymore.
