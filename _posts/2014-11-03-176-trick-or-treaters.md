It was raining this year and I think that put a damper on the trick-or-treat count. We also didn't put out our "Halloween projector" that puts a festive image on our garage, so I think the rain, combined with lack of decor, resulted in quite a bit fewer kids showing up. When it was busy, it was really busy; but when it wasn't... it was dead.

The graph is starting to look like a big mess so I will probably start keeping more like "the last five years" on there. I'll also keep an overall average graph to keep the bigger picture.

![Average Trick-or-Treaters by Time Block](https://hyqi8g-ch3302.files.1drv.com/y2pdoynEEZDAOA942NdK_K4Cz7FrsGFVTcO0xpzIRuG_Cfs30w9EpQC-lyEIBhReNpsIyb3fuOXmDzr5dDeN-SlviQo35F3lEu1XoUiNetgVTE/20141103_trickortreataverage.png?psid=1)

The table's also starting to get pretty wide; might have to switch it so time block goes across the top and year goes down.

My costume this year was the Tenth Doctor from _Doctor Who_. Jenn was Anna from _Frozen_. We both made our costumes and I'll post a different blog article walking through how I made the suit. Phoenix decided she was going to be Sleeping Beauty this time, which was a time-saver for us since she already has a ton of princess costumes.
