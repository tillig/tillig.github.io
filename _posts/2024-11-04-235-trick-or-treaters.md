This year we had 235 trick-or-treaters. That's a big increase from previous years.

Halloween was on a Thursday and it was raining on-and-off. However, there was no school on Friday, so kids were out and prepped for staying up late on a sugar high.

We technically started handing out candy at 5:30 because the number of kids this year starting early was overwhelming. I've grouped the 5:30p to 6:00p kids (24) in with the 6:00p - 6:30p kids (22) to total 46 in the 6:00p - 6:30p time block. It throws the curve off a little but we'll have to live with it.

We didn't hand out in 2022 (we were remodeling and not home) or 2023 (COVID). It was good to be back in the swing of things. I did throw out my back a few days before, so I tallied the kids while Jenn handed out candy, but we showed up!

Our costumes this year:

- Me: Newt Scamander from _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_
- Jenn: Sally Slater, the tightrope walker from the Disney Haunted Mansion
- Phoenix: Ursula from _The Little Mermaid_

I made the coat and the vest for this one. I bought the wand, pants, and shirt. I'm pretty pleased with how it turned out. The coat is really warm and is fully lined - it's not a costume pattern, it's a historic reproduction pattern. I wore it to our usual Halloween party but couldn't wear it all night. It was just too hot.

About halfway through making the coat I tried to push too much fabric through the serger so I broke it. It's at the shop now. I think I threw off the timing. I also recently acquired a cover stitch machine, but I didn't see any good places to use it on this costume. I'm excited to try it for a future project.
