It's been a busy year, and in particular a pretty crazy last-three-months, so I'm rounding out my 2015 by _finally_ using up my paid time off at work and effectively taking December off.

What that means is I probably [won't be seen on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/8116/travis-illig) or handling [Autofac](http://autofac.org/) issues or [working on the Autofac ASP.NET 5 conversion](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/594).

I love coding, but I also have a couple of challenges if I do that on my time off:

- **I stress out.** I'm not sure how other people work, but when I see questions and issues come in I feel like there's a need I'm not addressing or a problem I need to solve, somehow, _immediately right now_. Even if that just serves as a backlog of things to prioritize, it's one more thing on the list of things I'm not checking off. I want to help people and I want to provide great stuff with Autofac and the other projects I work on, but there is a non-zero amount of stress involved with that. It can pretty quickly turn from "good, motivating stress" to "bad, overwhelming stress." It's something I work on from a personal perspective, but taking a break from that helps me regain some focus.
- **I lose time.** There are _so many things_ I want to do that I don't have time for. I like [sewing]({{ site.url }}/archive/2015/11/02/85-trick-or-treaters/) and [making physical things]({{ site.url }}/archive/2015/08/25/exploding-tardis-dress/) - something I don't really get a chance to do in the software world. If I sit down and start coding stuff, pretty soon the day is gone and I may have made some interesting progress on a code-related project, but I just lost a day I could have addressed some of the other things I want to do. Since I code for a living (and am lucky enough to be able to get Autofac time in as part of work), I try to avoid doing much coding on my time off unless it's helping me contribute to my other hobbies. (For example, [I just got an embroidery machine](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AVMZA4?tag=mhsvortex) - I may code to create custom embroidery patterns.)

I don't really take vacation time during the year so I often end up in a "use it or lose it" situation come December, which works out well because there are a ton of holidays to work around anyway. Why not de-stress, unwind, and take the whole month off?

I may even get some time to outline some of the blog entries I've been meaning to post. I've been working on some cool stuff from [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) to [Roslyn code analyzers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn879356.aspx), not to mention the challenges we've run into with [Autofac/ASP.NET 5](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/issues/594). I've just been slammed enough that I haven't been able to get those out. We'll see. I should at least start keeping a list.
