Back in March 2014 I started converting my DVD rips into MP4 files for use with [Plex](http://plex.tv). I ran two laptops (both with 2.3GHz dual-core CPUs) 24/7 until early March 2015 when I added a third computer - an eight-core 4GHz machine.

**Today I finally finished converting all of my disc-based video content to MP4.**

Some quick statistics:

* Total number of files: 4998
* Total content runtime: 134 days, 8 hours, 56 minutes, 47 seconds
  * SD runtime: 115 days, 12 hours, 25 minutes, 17 seconds
  * HD runtime: 18 days, 20 hours, 31 minutes, 30 seconds
* Total file size: 5182.3GB
  * SD file size: 3042.04GB
  * HD file size: 2140.26GB
* Average MB/minute for SD content: 18.73
* Average MB/minute for HD content: 80.72

I'm pretty pleased with how everything has come together. Seeing it all in Plex, nicely organized... it's a good feeling.

**I can definitely say CPU power is important in video conversion.** My laptops could convert an average SD movie in three or four hours, but an HD movie... I couldn't get one converted in a day. The eight-core behemoth can take the same SD movie and finish in an hour or less; and HD movies take about four hours - same as SD content on my laptops.

Anyway, if you're looking to convert a bunch of video, it's worth investing in some hefty CPU power. It'll save you tons of time.

**Finally, as part of this, I'd like to introduce [my media center documentation on ReadTheDocs](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.io).**

It's a work in progress, so this is sort of a "soft launch," but I think it's fleshed out enough to be of some use. I will probably do a more dedicated blog entry for it when I've got more of it filled out.

Information about [how I converted my stuff with Handbrake](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software/convert/handbrake.html), including the script I used to pull the report data above, as well as the [specs for my behemoth conversion/Plex server](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/server/megaplex.html), is all [over there](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.io).
