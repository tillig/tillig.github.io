This year we had 190 trick-or-treaters. This amount is about average for us.

Halloween was on a Thursday and and the weather was fairly clear. We had some friends come over so there was a small group who went out walking the streets for candy and another small group who stayed home and handed out candy. I was in the "stay home" group.

I noticed I don't have 2017 or 2018 data.

In 2017 we were doing a fairly major downstairs remodel and didn't hand out candy. There was a bunch of construction stuff in the driveway that we didn't want kids getting into or trying to scoot past.

We did hand out candy in 2018 and I'm sure we tallied it but I have _no idea_ where that tally went. I didn't even blog my costume from last year (I went as Doctor Strange). My mind is going.

Cumulative data:
