This year we had 140 trick-or-treaters. This is pretty low for us, but I can't complain since it's the first year after COVID-19.

Halloween was on a Sunday and it was chilly and windy. It had been raining a bit but didn't rain during prime trick-or-treat time.

We didn't hand out candy last year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Looking up and down our street, it appeared a lot of people chose again this year to not hand out candy. We also saw some "take one" bowls on porches and various creative "candy torpedo tubes" that would send candy from the porch to the kid in a distanced fashion.
