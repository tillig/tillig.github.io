I was doing some AutoMapper-ing the other day, converting my data object...

```c#
public class Source
{
  public Source();
  public string Description { get; set; }
  public DateTimeOffset? ExpireDateTime { get; set; }
  public string Value { get; set; }
}
```

...into an object needed for a system we're integrating with.

```c#
public class Destination
{
  public Destination();
  public Destination(string value, DateTime? expiration = null);
  public Destination(string value, string description, DateTime? expiration = null);
  public string Description { get; set; }
  public DateTime? Expiration { get; set; }
  public string Value { get; set; }
}
```

It appeared to me that the most difficult thing here was going to be mapping `ExpireDateTime` to `Expiration`. Unfortunately, this was more like [a three-hour tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island).

I started out creating the mapping like this (in a mapping `Profile`):

```c#
// This is not the answer.
this.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Expiration, opt.MapFrom(src => src.ExpireDateTime));
```

This didn't work because there's no mapping from `DateTimeOffset?` to `DateTime?`. I next made a mistake that I think I make every time I run into this and have to relearn it, which is that I created that mapping, too.

```c#
// Still not right.
this.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Expiration, opt.MapFrom(src => src.ExpireDateTime));
this.CreateMap<DateTimeOffset?, DateTime?>()
    .ConvertUsing(input => input.HasValue ? input.Value.DateTime : null);
```

It took a few tests to realize that **AutoMapper handles nullable for you**, so I was able to simplify a bit.

```c#
// Getting closer - don't map nullable, map the base type.
this.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Expiration, opt.MapFrom(src => src.ExpireDateTime));
this.CreateMap<DateTimeOffset, DateTime>()
    .ConvertUsing(input => input.DateTime);
```

However, it seemed that no matter what I did, the `Destination.Expiration` was _always null_. For the life of me, I couldn't figure it out.

Then I had one of those "eureka" moments when I was thinking about [how Autofac handles constructors](https://autofac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/register/registration.html#specifying-a-constructor): It chooses the constructor with the most parameters that it can fulfill from the set of registered services.

I looked again at that `Destination` object and realized there were _three constructors_, two of which default the `Expiration` value to null. [AutoMapper also handles constructors](https://docs.automapper.org/en/latest/Queryable-Extensions.html#custom-destination-type-constructors) in a way similar to Autofac. From the docs about `ConstructUsing`:

> AutoMapper will automatically match up destination constructor parameters to source members based on matching names, so only use this method if AutoMapper canâ€™t match up the destination constructor properly, or if you need extra customization during construction.

**That's it! The answer is to pick the zero-parameter constructor** so the mapping isn't skipped.

```c#
// This is the answer!
this.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Expiration, opt.MapFrom(src => src.ExpireDateTime))
    .ConstructUsing((input, context) => new Destination());
this.CreateMap<DateTimeOffset, DateTime>()
    .ConvertUsing(input => input.DateTime);
```

Hopefully that will save you some time if you run into it. Also, hopefully it will save _me_ some time next time I'm stumped because I can search and find my own blog... which happens more often than you might think.
