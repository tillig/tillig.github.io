I finally got my own Stranger Things lights done with Arduino. Here's a video of it in action.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxTzynmiZcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The video doesn't show all the things it does - there are four different messages and a couple of light effects.

[I posted the walkthrough of how I did it and all the Arduino source right on GitHub!](https://github.com/tillig/stranger-things-lights)
