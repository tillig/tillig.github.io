We finally did it: **We cut the cable.**

On Friday, we took all the cable boxes back to Comcast, cut off the cable TV and the phones, and we're down to internet service and mobile phones only.

I have to say, I know I'm only a few days into it but I haven't really noticed it. Aside from calling my various financial institutions and utilities to change my phone number with them, it's pretty status quo. We were already watching most of our stuff on demand or through online services anyway.

**[If you'd like to know what I did or how I did it, I documented the whole plan.](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plans/cuttingthecable.html)** I'll do a blog entry later for the official release of my media center documentation site, but you can [read over there](http://illigmediacenter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plans/cuttingthecable.html) about my cable cutting plan: what we did and the equipment/services we use.
