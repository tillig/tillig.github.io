I just pushed [`Autofac.Multitenant` 4.0.0-beta8-216](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autofac.Multitenant/4.0.0-beta8-216) to NuGet.

This update includes some breaking changes from the previous `Autofac.Extras.Multitenant` package:

- Multitenant support has been promoted to first-class. The package is now **`Autofac.Multitenant` and not `Autofac.Extras.Multitenant`**. (Note the "Extras" part is gone. We always talked about how, at some point, an "Extras" package might become a core feature, figured it was time to finally actually do that.)
- This package requires `Autofac` 4.0.0-beta8-* and up because...
- The multitenant support has been updated to support the same set of portable platforms that core Autofac supports (`dnx451`, `dotnet`, `net45`, `netcore45`).
- This builds on top of DNX beta 8.

If you're using DNX and want to try out multitenancy, [give this a shot](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autofac.Multitenant/4.0.0-beta8-216). If you find any issues, [please let us know at the Autofac.Multitenant repo!](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac.Multitenant)
