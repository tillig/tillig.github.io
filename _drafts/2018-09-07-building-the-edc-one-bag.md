While I have made a lot of costumes and clothing, I've never previously sewn a bag. When I saw [the YouTube video of Adam Savage building his EDC TWO bag](https://www.tested.com/art/makers/836133-adam-savages-one-day-builds-edc-2-bag/), it made me want to build a bag, too.

In the video he mentioned that the EDC TWO is slightly smaller than the EDC ONE and I wanted to make the full-sized bag. He sells the plans for both, but I bought the [EDC ONE pattern](https://adamsavage.com/collections/plans-tools/products/savage-industries-edc-one-plans). I see that since the time I bought it he's now offering it in your choice of physical/paper plans or a PDF download. I'm glad I bought the paper plans; it's huge and I don't have a printer that would accommodate such a thing. Taping a million sheets of paper together isn't my style.

The pattern is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). I think that means you could technically distribute the pattern for free as long as you give credit, but it's all of $15 and I feel good contributing to someone who put something cool together. I don't think my explanation here really needs a license, but assuming it does, let's also use that same license with the same restrictions, etc.

OK, let's get this going.

# Assumptions

I will make some assumptions as I go along here about a few things. You may have to Google some stuff if you don't know what I'm talking about. Here's what I assume:

- **You have the EDC ONE pattern.** I'm not going to give you the pattern here. I'm going to show you how I used it and call things out about it.
- **You have some sewing experience.** If I mention that I basted two pieces together, you should know it doesn't have anything to do with a turkey baster. Tons of YouTube videos and articles out there to catch you up if you don't recognize what I'm talking about.

# Improvements and Errata

Along the way I'll point out the improvements that could be made in the pattern as well as some of the "bugs" I encountered in the pattern or provided instructions. If you're building along here, it'd be good to read through all of this first so you might know what's coming.

# Initial References

- [EDC ONE bag](https://adamsavage.com/products/savage-industries-edc-one) - This is what the bag looks like fully put together. Really helpful for reference photos to see if you're building things right.
- [EDC ONE pattern](https://adamsavage.com/collections/plans-tools/products/savage-industries-edc-one-plans) - This is the pattern I bought.

When looking at the pictures of the finished bag and comparing to the pattern, I took some notes.

Front:

[![Notes on the EDC ONE reference photo - front]({{ site.url }}/images/edcone/small/refnotesfront.jpg)]({{ site.url }}/images/edcone/large/refnotesfront.jpg)

- The pattern calls for lobster claws to hold the shoulder strap. The lobster claw they use isn't like anything I've seen. I searched and couldn't find anything like that.
- You can see the stitching that attaches the metal frame holder channel inside the bag. The pattern doesn't specifically say you need to sew through all thicknesses when attaching that, so its good to know that's what's happening.

Back:

- The pattern calls for "tube magnets" to put in the handles. I'll get into this later, but I couldn't figure out what this was and the picture didn't make it any more clear.
- The "D rings" used to hold the handles on look more square here than standard D rings. I ended up using rectangle rings instead of D rings.
- The shadow on the bag shows that the metal frame you insert in each side of the bag opening may not go the full width of the side - there's space between where the two frame halves end to allow the bag opening to bend freely.

Inside:

[![Notes on the EDC ONE reference photo - inside]({{ site.url }}/images/edcone/small/refnotesinside.jpg)]({{ site.url }}/images/edcone/large/refnotesinside.jpg)

- Again, you can see the frame holder is stitched to the bag through all thicknesses. There's no crafty seam hiding here.
- Also, again, you can see the metal frame appears slightly shorter than the width of the bag to allow the bag to open and close easily.
